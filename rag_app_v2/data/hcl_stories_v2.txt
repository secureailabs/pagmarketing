The hematologist did a bone marrow biopsy, and that's when Jane was diagnosed with Hairy cell leukemia. She was shocked and scared. She had never even heard of the disease before, and now she had to deal with it.

The hematologist explained that Hairy cell leukemia is a rare type of blood cancer that affects the bone marrow, which is where blood cells are made. It's called ""Hairy"" cell leukemia because the leukemia cells have hair-like projections on their surface. These projections can make the cells look hairy under a microscope.

Jane's doctor prescribed a chemotherapy drug called cladribine. The drug was given to her as an infusion, and she had to stay in the hospital for five days. She didn't experience any side effects during the infusion, but a few days later, she started to feel nauseous and tired.
