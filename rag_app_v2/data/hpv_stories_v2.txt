Sarah was really upset about this diagnosis as she had always been very careful with her sexual health. But, the gynecologist told her that HPV is very common and that most sexually active people will contract it at some point in their lives.

After discussing the different treatment options with her doctor, Sarah decided to go with cryotherapy. This involved freezing the affected areas with liquid nitrogen. The procedure was uncomfortable, but Sarah was relieved to hear that the bumps should clear up in a few weeks.

Unfortunately, Sarah's journey with HPV didn't end there. A few months later, she had her first abnormal pap smear. Her doctor recommended that she have a colposcopy, which involves examining the cervix with a special instrument.

The results of the colposcopy showed that Sarah had CIN 2, which is a precancerous lesion. Her doctor recommended that she have a LEEP procedure, which involves removing the abnormal tissue with a wire loop that is heated with electricity.

Sarah was nervous about having surgery, but she knew it was the best option for her. The procedure went well, and her doctor told her that the margins were clear, which meant that all of the abnormal tissue had been removed.

Since her LEEP procedure, Sarah has been going for regular check-ups and has had normal pap smears. She feels relieved that she caught her HPV early and took proactive steps to prevent it from developing into something more serious.

Sarah's doctor explained that HPV is very common and that most people clear the virus on their own. However, in some cases, it can lead to abnormal cells and even cancer. Sarah was scared and didn't know what to do next.

After some research, Sarah decided to get the HPV vaccine to protect herself against other strains of the virus. Her doctor also recommended regular Pap tests to monitor any changes in her cervix.

The results came back positive for precancerous cells. Sarah was devastated once again. She didn't know how this was happening to her, and she felt like her body was failing her.

To treat the precancerous cells, Sarah's doctor recommended a procedure called a LEEP, which stands for Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure. During this procedure, the abnormal cells are removed from the cervix using a thin wire loop that cuts away the tissue.

Sarah was nervous about the LEEP, but she knew she had to go through with it to protect her health. The procedure was uncomfortable, but it was over quickly. Sarah was relieved when her doctor told her that the LEEP was successful and that the precancerous cells were gone.
