She made plans with you and her best friend and then (it seems like) she tried to dip and leave yall two by yourself? She’s trying to be nice and not hurt your pride/feelings, but she is being pretty clear that she is not interested in pursuing this romantically. It sucks, but you’ll find someone who you click better with! Good luck, dude!"
1,k8ks91w,comment,sp00kens_,deadbydaylight,1699574872,Yea I think the ranking system is weird. I don’t like that we can’t see our rank that pairs us with people and we can’t choose to play against more/less advanced players. I’ll go through a rough patch after a long break and be paired with total newbies and it just gets boring after a while
2,k8kroj4,comment,sp00kens_,deadbydaylight,1699574628,"I feel for you. I feel like (in my experience) I haven’t had enough people use anti hook builds to really annoy me all that much. Like, I’ve definitely had a few, and it’s like bruh. But I guess since they haven’t been as common for me, it’s more startling and feels more rewarding when I rehook the mf."
3,k8kr7q6,comment,sp00kens_,deadbydaylight,1699574429,"Yea. It’s super annoying when they do that :/ It’s like.. yea thanks for gloating. Especially when they crouch like a madman at gate/hatch or flash their light at you. Tho, I have been able to down someone right at gate with oni blood fury and hook them. Hopefully as I get better I can do shit like that more often. I doubt that player will taunt killers as often. Or at least they’ll think twice about it."

16,k8hb987,comment,sp00kens_,piercing,1699521696,If that’s the case I’d stick with bridge. It’s less likely to fuck up imo. (I’m Not a piercer tho so idk). Snakebites can go south real fast if someone screws them up (nerves and such)
17,k8hamn2,comment,sp00kens_,piercing,1699521182,"Bridge was easier than snakebites process wise for me! (I got my snakebites earlier this year, but haven’t posted them). My bf and I got them at the same time (his first piercing other than ears). Those also didn’t hurt but I have a weak stomach with piercing through thick parts of the skin for some reason so they grossed me out. My bf thought the second piercing hurt way more than the first. 
Make sure that regardless you go to a good piercer who will use good materials that honestly will make or break you!"
18,k8hadxs,comment,sp00kens_,piercing,1699520984,"Na ur good haha! Thank you: I hope to complete my face with replacing my vertical labret with a normal labret, getting my dimples done, high nostrils, and tongue &gt;:D 
My bridge didn’t hurt when it got pierced at all. I’ve had it for almost a year and a half I think, and it is honestly my most fussy piercing. It requires a lot of care with saline and will flare up if i wear any makeup or if there’s a lot of dust around. It’s never really painful tho, but it definitely likes to get irritated. I will also say, I get hairs stuck in it (my eyebrow piercings too).. buuut I shave my eyebrows so that’s the likely culprit. When that happens it uncomfortable but like not painful. 🫡 hope that helped!"
19,k8h9wst,comment,sp00kens_,piercing,1699520598,Hell yea! Update me on the tongue piercing process!! I have a fuckton of facial piercings but I rlly want a tongue: would love to hear how the process goes! 🫡🫡 goodluck with your piercing journey!!

21,k8h9dz4,comment,sp00kens_,DrMartens,1699520161,"So I just broke in my Jaden maxes! It sucked :D BUT, I used these blister pads I got at CVS.. they’re like bubbled up and raised/padded. They worked really well. I layered like two-three of them (one on the lowest part of my foot, one right above it, and one in the middle), and paired it with two layers of socks (yea yea yea I know “friction”.. BUT I found that if I put on a thicker pair underneath a tight fitting pair it reduces the friction and is cushioning enough to actually walk in it). Alternatively, use some super thick socks with it, and wear them daily. Fr just wearing them is the key to breaking them in. It sucks, but after like 3-4 days of agony and wearing them constantly, they break in. (Also have to come with a forewarning that I now have a blister scar that is the side of my entire heel, so do with that what you will)"

I was initially going to down him and hook him but had a change of heart. I dropped him in front of the exit, let him open the door a bit, yoinked him, dropped him, yoinked him, dropped him, let him open the door, slugged him, and let him crawl to the exit at the last second before time ran out.

I’ve had to call off for uni classes and likely will have to call off for work tomorrow too :/ It started as just a post nasal drip and VERY quickly escalated to my entire body hurting and aching, feeling fevery (but without a proper fever), sneezing, coughing, dizziness (probably from the congestion in my ears), chest pains, etc. I’m a pretty frequent weed smoker, and a sometimes vape partaker but have laid off of both since I started my symptoms. I can’t sleep. I feel like I can’t breathe. I’m too hot or too cold at any given moment, my body hurts, and it’s making me frustrated and cranky. If I’m feeling like shit in the morning I’m going to the doctor, but does this sound like flu? Is there anything that will actually help? I’ve tried DayQuil (I didn’t have niquil and didn’t feel like spending more money), Vic’s vapor rub, Vic’s vapor stick, yogi cold season tea, homemade garlic soup, chicken soup, zinc, zicam spray, cough drops, baths, steaming the room, Netti pot (idk if spelled right), drinking hella water.

69,k7gg93v,comment,sp00kens_,pumpkincarving,1698892479,"Between 4 and 2… here’s my reasoning:
Number 4 has really solid curves and sharp edges, but is a simple pumpkin carve: no layering of pumpkin, and no extra steps. It’s a simple, classic (and very good) pumpkin carve. I will say, however the guts are pretty gangly inside. Which, while it isn’t THAT big of a deal, it definitely has to take off some points because a clean inside pumpkin is apart of the artistry itself. OVERALL, It is VERY clean tho: the lines are SOLID so it makes it a really impressive piece. Super iconic and recognizable character too! 
Number 2, however, is using a bunch of different techniques. While the lines aren’t as clean and precise, the organic feel of it makes is charming. It’s very recognizable as a pug, and the inside of that pumpkin is CLEAN. Those walls don’t have a scrap of pumpkin guts: it looks smooth as marble up in that bitch. Some of the inside lines are a lil choppy, tho, but overall the bold design, along with the cool layering/ opacity effects makes it super solid! Also points on creativity. 

Everyone had such cute pumpkins&lt;3"

I went to the website to try to track it and realize that it was tracking through, UPS/FedEx. On the website it said to drop off at a UPS location, but the IMEI/ESN/Serial number sent me to a FedEx link so I’m not sure which one is correct. I made the silly blunder of dropping off my package at USPS since I misheard the person in the AT&amp;T store when they told me what carrier to bring it to and I didn’t think to check the label because again I’m a stupid idiot.

But some I HIGHLY recommend (and still listen to):
- Janis Joplin (Queen. She’s bluesy-60/70s rock) 

- Stevie nicks (duh. She makes me feel all warm and fuzzy: her voice reminds me of autumn)

- the band “Shocking blue” had a great lead singer, Mariska veres (I love their band stuff tho more than her solo work)

- siouxsie and the banshees (amazing female goth band — iconic and classic, too)

- hole (admittedly kinda mid but I love them. Punky girl band)

- Bikini kill ( ^ kinda same)

- vainco Doble (amazing duo of sisters. 
Psychedelic and in Spanish, but amazing)

- cibo matto (just listen to it: so fuckin good) 

- Vashti Bunyan (her voice makes me feel nostalgic for my childhood.. like a mothers lullaby)

- the band Spirogyra (NOT the jazz band, but this psychedelic band from the 60s has an AMAZNG female lead singer. She doesn’t sing for all the songs tho and the guys voice is mid, at best. BUT search up bells and whistles by Spirogyra on YouTube. Greenish color with the band members on it. So good) 

- Tracy Chapman (black, lesbian, female songwriter and artist. Iconic as fuck)

- Crass (another female lead punk band. Iconic as FUCK)

- kittie (another guilty pleasure: they’re like if dad rock was girls. Like angry aunt rock idk)

- boy harsher (another goth band with a female lead)

- Joan Jett (rock goddess. Praise her. I love her)

- Patti Smith (iconic. “Punk” but not rlly, but definitely helped shape the genre ) 

- Dolly Parton &lt;3

- portishead (if you Ike bjork this is very different but also similar vibes imo)

- fka twigs (^ same but also very different("
85,k6wjkng,comment,sp00kens_,texts,1698545799,Na.. this seems way more in line with wanting to know you’re doing what you really say you are disguised as a wanting to surprise you with something nice. If he wanted to surprise you he coulda done that the next time y’all saw eachother. Sounds like he was obsessive and felt the need to monitor you: sorry you went through that… those relationships are hard

This gives very similar energy to what I went through on a daily basis.

It made me extremely anxious all the time and I couldn’t stay off my phone for ANYTHING. I couldn’t enjoy my time with my family or my friends or myself because I was in fear that he would accuse me of fucking someone. My family had a male Au Pair (a foreign nanny… because my family was too busy to raise the three of us) when I was 18. He wasn’t responsible for me bc I was already grown, but he lived in our house. My ex had my location and it wasn’t ever accurate to the specific room I was in but he always SWORE that my location eas showing as the male au pair’s room. I never even flirted with another person when he and I were together. Turns out that he was projecting the entire time and had cheated emotionally, physically, digitally, with over 11 girls (I’m still finding out people he cheated on me with TO THIS DAY… it’s been over 4 years and we haven’t spoken in at least three)… Anyways moral of the story: if they’re monitoring you this closely and this mad that you don’t update them and are THIS accusatory… it’s probably because they aren’t trustworthy themselves. After all, if they’ll do it to you, that obviously means you’d do it to them, right? Anyways ESCAPE WHILE YOU CAN."

I am a very big horror fan, and I am really into Gore, but also psychological horror. I also have a preference towards female writers, but it doesn’t keep me away from a book if it’s good. I’m very particular with the literature that I like to read.. which is why I took such a long hiatus from reading, and eventually fell out of it during my time in university until recently when I decided to get back into it since I used to read quite often. Anything like in a similar realm, I have been recommended tenders is the flesh, perfume, and Lolita, all novels that I currently own, but have not yet gotten to. But, as I am filling my spare time with reading instead of phone scrolling, I have realized that I’m finishing books quickly and would like to have a queue on hand for what I should read next. Any, and all suggestions will be considered! If possible, when recommending a book, please give a short synopsis/vibe of it. I like anything uncomfortable, anything that makes you think deeply about the human condition, and general horror. I don’t really love horror without substance if that makes any sense. So anything that’s like deeply psychological, and isn’t necessarily horror I still would appreciate reading! Thank you in advance, guys :)"

123,t3_17aog7q,post,sp00kens_,cats,1697628513,"Guys ugh. My oldest cat, Papageno is about 5 years old. He didn’t start peeing on stuff until he was like 3 and I think it began as retaliation for me not being home often (I had extreme depression at the time and whenever I went back to my dorm room/college apartment I would get into a very unhealthy state. I spent most of my time at my partner’s or at my family home). This only went on for less than a year before my partner and I moved in together and my family moved away. My cat is one of three and has taught our young female cat, Bug, to also pee on things. He pees on clean clothes, the hardwood floor, my bed (which we don’t use, but had to throw away because it was covered in cat piss), the couch, and worst of all my boyfriend’s bed. That’s the bed we primarily sleep on. He has peed directly on either me or my boyfriend multiple times and he woke us up by peeing on my boyfriend literally just now. My boyfriend is getting super tired of it and I don’t blame him. It is not a box issue… We have 4 boxes (5 if you include the tiny pan we still have from when our kitten was teeny, but they hardly use that), and I clean them regularly. My cat is VERY food driven, and my boyfriend is the one who feeds all the cats in the morning since he wakes up before me. We think maybe my cat was hungry (since he usually stands on my boyfriend to wake him ip for food). I just don’t know what to do. My parents are trying to convince my boyfriend to get rid of the cat. He loves Papageno, but he is so tired of the piss. I don’t blame him. We have had to wash the sheets 3 times this week :/ Because either he or our other cat, Bug, decided to pee on the bed. We usually keep the room door closed during the day to prevent this… but at night we leave it open so that the animals can come and go (we have a lot of pets, and the dogs sleep with us. Our youngest kitten also sleeps with us, but he likes to play around first so keeping the door open so he can access the rooms that has his toys and scratch post in is important). What can I do? I know I’ve come here before but I feel so lost. We don’t really have the financial ability to put Papageno through any training or anything.. ugh.
Also, he is healthy. A bit overweight, and on a weight loss journey, and he has a heart murmur but the vet said that he is overall fine and to just keep an eye on him to see if it becomes an issue (he believes it may be weight related)"

After which, I gained weight up to 190lbs without any major diet changes or lifestyle changes. anywho— I have come off the medication (I was on it for 2 years) and I am losing weight. My goal is 140lbs and I am currently at 183lbs. I am also cutting calories and (lightly) working out like going on walks daily. I used to have very perky breasts and was about a B cup. I’m now a C/D cup depending on where I go, and as I’ve lost weight, have noticed some droop to my breasts. My boyfriend also noticed and while he doesn’t think it’s a bad thing, it bothers me that he notices because he used to always compliment my breasts when they were perky. Anyways, is there anything other than surgery to combat dropping breasts during weight loss or am I forever doomed? For people who have lost that much weight and have breasts, did it do a crazy number on you???"

I would try to be honest with your mom if you have a good relationship with her: im sure she will be more pissed at the assholes who did that to you, than at you (she likely won’t even be mad at you at all). It may feel better to have somebody who loves you there to comfort you in this time. I would for sure report the incident. Even if it wasn’t a rape situation, they assaulted you. But just remember that you were under the influence in the first place, which means you couldn’t consent anyways so report this so that you can get some form of justice. Also as others have said to get a rape kit, and I think you should too. Be easy on yourself: this is so traumatic. Your feelings are valid, and just know that we’re all standing by you here."

Grew up and decided horror (particularly gore/ campy over the top gore) is my favorite genre. Watched the saw movies. Love them. (Sorry this post is so iritic, I just want to be able to express my excitement). But yea, I begged and begged for him to take me for my birthday (he thinks saw Is kinda lame and relies on gore too much but whatever lmao). He said we had other surprise plans and I literally said to cancel them bc I’ve been excited for this movie for the past year. Turns out he WAS gonna take me and I ruined my own surprise BUT I’m so excited. Been trying to avoid spoilers, but people who have seen it: is it good???? Like how does it add up to the other movies in the franchise? Without any major plot spoilers, please, I just wanna get hyped for this movie I’m so excited."
148,t3_16m8dav,post,sp00kens_,musicals,1695073507,"Hey y’all! Sorry for the super lame post, but I am a university student who is taking a drama one course this semester. I have been a vocal performance major for the majority of my college career, and now I am an art major, but I guess that’s beside the point. I know a lot about operas, but my musical knowledge definitely is lacking. 
When my prof. paired us up into couples, I got placed with an individual who I already really didn’t vibe with (for my own reasons.. that’s beside the point, tho). I just really wanted this process to go smoothly so I said they could pick the subject (also since I’m not super knowledgeable about musical theatre) and they chose the SpongeBob musical… y’all I’m not even gonna lie: I am NOT a fan of SpongeBob. Even as a kid, when my siblings would watch it , I got so annoyed by the characters. Just not my taste. But I agreed since I didn’t want to start any further conflict with this individual. I basically did all the research for the project, and then had to beg them to just plug it into a power point. We got the synopsis, the background work going into it, credits, artists attached to it, and then the songs. After watching another students presentation, my ppartner asked me if I thought that what we had was good enough, I responded that I thought it was fine and that I wasn’t upset if we didn’t get an a. But that if they wanted to add some thing to the presentation they totally could (I got this thing done super early for a reason…. I’m working every day this week after classes, and have my boyfriend’s little sister’s birthday that we’re prepping for ontop of my usual school load and having to take care of my house and personal errands). They said they could try… which leads me here. Guys I do not like this musical and I didn’t like the music. I tried to watch it, but I couldn’t make it through. I won’t have time this week to watch the whole thing anyways. Call me lazy, or whatever, but … guys please.. Are there any particular clips, were scenes that stand out as important? Is there any thing that’s worth going into detail about this musical that we can write about? Just anything really, the meeting, anything special about it that you guys may think could really help me out here. I know I’m coming out as really pessimistic… but I am already really frustrated that I’m working extra on a subject I do not like at all, and with an individual whom I do not get along with.. I’m honestly fine with a C (though I feel like we’d get a B at the lowest…) I know that they REALLY want an A, so I guess please help me help them.."

Tbh on a lower dose than usual (both times were caused my something though: first was bc nicotine and second because I was trying to fight myself mentally against the shrooms). I DO find that ginger helps a lot when it comes to the feeling of oh shit I’m about to puke. I heard bananas help… but idk both times I puked I ate a banana/ took the shrooms with a banana smoothie and those were someu of the only times I bananaed and shroomed at the same time.

I couldn’t have sex because it made me so anxious. It was broad daylight too. It’s entirely possible your partner really didn’t know, especially if he had been half asleep when it happened, AND on LSD, AND drunk asf. Honestly, it sounds like this other girl may be in the wrong.. But she could’ve just been tripping out too, and thought it was okay/ didn’t realize what was going on. I would definitely hold off on engagement for now, but maybe seek some therapy for the two of you to see if you can overcome this. If he was sexually assaulted, he probably has a lot of baggage about it too. When you’re on any psychedelic you are VERY vulnerable, and it kinda affects everybody differently. I would give him the benefit of the doubt, tbh. I doubt he would knowingly cheat IN PUBLIC, while you were in the same area, and about to come back. Just ain’t no way, imo."

Once I moved out, I got plenty more. I now have 9 facial piercings, stretched lobes, stretched septum, nipple piercings, and a bellybutton piercing. For reference, I’m almost 22 lol.

156,jz4o819,comment,sp00kens_,relationship_advice,1693853025,"Honestly it sounds like she’s not ove ex and is using you as a rebound until she can either get back with him or find someone else. That’s the hard truth. If she’s still in contact with an ex that she’s not over, that’s not cool and it is very clearly crossing a boundary that you explicitly set. The photos she’s taken aren’t really the problem, but perhaps she wants to post them to get his attention (maybe not, maybe so. Maybe she just wants to post them because she felt sexy and confident, but there is likely an inkling in her mind hoping that her ex sees it). Honestly, this relationship seems a bit of a mess. Don’t be the rebound, and certainly don’t let this girl walk all over you. And like you said, not that it matters if she was a virgin or you were her first love, but the fact that she went out of her way to lie to you saying so is definitely concerning. It’s only been 10 months: I’d split now before it gets even

Ugh y’all. Idk what’s up with the universe but shit has hit the fan in every direction of my life, with leaving my job due to extreme toxicity to our cat passing to our new kitten getting ringworm to my car accident. Basically money is TIGHT.. last week, when I went to change the bedding of my rats’ (4 female: two of which are double Rex girlies), I saw our oldest rat, Dapple was EXTREMELY skinny. This really worried me because one of our rats, Apricot, has always been sort of a bully with food, even when I put out multiple bowls. Dapple was a little bit older  (2 years old) we think than Apricot, and we got her (dapple) from a pet store because we felt bad that she and her sister (who passed very tragically last year) were the only rats in the cage. I immediately took her out of the cage and tried to hand feed her, but she didn’t seem too interested. I noticed she had a ton of little red spots and some white/clear moving dust on her. Alarm bells immediately went up thinking it was lice. I wanted to take her to a vet, but I literally had no money to spare since life fucked me all at once. I gave her a dawn soap bath, bleached the cage and froze any bedding I would put in, and kept her desperate from the other rats. The next day she was looking a lot better and was happier to accept food, so I (stupidly), threw one of our younger rats (9 months old), Silk, into her cage so she wouldn’t be so lonely. I kept a close eye on them, and started preparing myself for the worst since I knew Dapple was nearing the end of her life span, and she was not looking good.. (she seemed better but still very far from healthy). About 3 days passed, and this evening I found Dapple in the corner, passed away. My partner and I had a collective sob fest, before removing her from her cage. Guys she was COVERED in those red dots and a fuck ton of moving clear/white something (again we suspect lice). We saved her body in the freezer since we are bone and wet specimen artists and have a tradition to memorialize our pet rats after they pass and are trying to figure out what to do with her. Silk, the girl we put in there with her, had a pretty significant amount of red spots but nothing moving we could see. Apricot also had some, but Satin (our other young double rex rat) had nothing.. She’s going through a balding she’d atm (normal for double Rex rats). I’ve pulled together just enough to buy some ivermectin to treat everyone, and some lice combs. But I’m ngl I’m freaking out and feel so horrible atp. I keep telling my partner that I feel like we’re neglecting them dude to our financial situation rn, but he keeps trying to assure me that we can get through this with proper care. I want to make sure they get the treatment they need.. is this enough? Anyways thank you for reading my anxiety ridden post.

TLDR: My 2 yr rat passed but had a crazy infestation of… lice? mites? My other rats have caught it and I cannot afford vet care due to a series of events that have wiped me out financially"

He is technically a foster, due to his inability to be fixed yet since he’s too small, and we got him from the shelter that requires neutering before official adoption. We got him about two weeks ago, and he’s been having diarrhea and has these crazy scabs that are starting to flake off. We’ve taken him to the shelter vet, and they said that the diarrhea is likely due to the change in his food and said he was parasite free. They said, regarding his scabs they weren’t sure what it was, but to treat it like ringworm. We’re treating it just as we’re supposed to, but I wonder if it really is ringworm or if it’s something else? I know he had fleas really bad when he was a kitten, but the vet said that it wasn’t likely outcome of his scabbing now. Both my partner, me, and all of our other pets haven’t shown signs of ringworm or any lesions similar to it, do y’all think this is ringworm? I’m gonna continue to treat it as such just in case, but just for a little peace of mind, I’d like to know a second opinion. Also would like to add that he was dewormed and is now being dewormed with a different medication! He is underweight, but getting there! (1.8 lbs and you can see every bone in his body… :( He’s plumping up though from when we first picked him up)"

So, basically it started with my psychiatrist and I deciding to fully finish tapering off my antidepressant/anti anxiety (SNRI).. It was a really hard process since the withdrawals were really intense, but I got threw it yay! I did shrooms the last day of my medication and it was a really intense trip… Next day, I found out my cat had a urinary block: we took him to the vet for care and they basically did Jack shit and he died a week later even after our constant communication with the vet, and surveillance along with following all the steps. Honestly, it was so fucking heartbreaking, and infuriating because the reason I had to go to this shorty vet was because my check from work was late AGAIN, which meant I had to go to the cheapest vet in town. After my cat died, a bunch of drama happened at my job (I was looking for new places anyways). O basically my boss ended up firing half the staff (the two other managers) because one of them got a second job and the second one lived with her and defended her and my boss didn’t like that so let them both go. That literally left just me, my boss, and my other coworker who is never scheduled because she always asks off. Basically all the shitty work went to me, and it included all the Halloween inventory (it’s a costume/sex shop/ ravewear shop). I was already looking for another job, so when my boss came up to me to tell me what happened and asked if I wanted to stay or if I “wanted to leave like everybody else,” I decided to put in my two weeks so I wouldn’t have to deal with the process of working way way extra for the same not-so-great pay. Whatever. The next two weeks we’re terrIBLE. We had a white linen night and I was upstairs (with the sex toys) by myself with no visible floor because it was packed so tight. People were drinking too, and so they were drinking and playing with the toys and it was just so much and I’m so frustrated that everyone else was downstairs. The next day I spent all day cleaning up the place alone because my boss called out for feeling tired and sick after the event even though she just ran register and basically got to be in one spot all night. The next day was finally my off day but my immune system took a blow and I was literally bed ridden all day. During the next day my partner and I decided to adopt a new kitten into the family because our other cats were acting depressed and we just felt a hole. My cat, bug, started showing signs of being sick so we took her and her big brother to the vet just for them to tell us that she was depressed and that’s it. Literally the day after, we noticed scabs on our kittens face and scheduled an appointment with the shelters vet. They said it was probably ring worm and we’ve been trying to quarantine the kitten but it’s but he yells so much and I just feel so horrible since I’m trying to bond with him. So far we or none of our other pets have gotten it so I hope not… Same day I took the kitten to the vet, I got into a caraccident and I just feel so shitty about it. There was no parking outside my apartment or around it other than the spot closest to the fire hydrant which I never park near just in car because I have a pretty shitty sense of measurement and I didn’t ever want to risk a ticket…. should’ve just parked behind my boyfriends truck In the back because when I went to my car THERE AS A FUCKING CITATION LETTER. Worst part is….. I was just under 14 feet away and the mandatory is 15. I’m just so Aggggggg. I have no job right now (I have an interview tomorrow so wish me luck PLEASE). I just want my bad luck streak o end. Idk if I can take much more"

Been smoking again but not all day or everyday like I was and not having issues so far but keeping the thc levels around 15% I also am curious if a lot of us aren’t getting CHS  and serotonin syndrome mixed up. Seems like most of us on here are on some sort of SSRI

253,js7yl5b,comment,Longjumping_Rich_420,CHSinfo,1689532136,Mine was bad at first laying down. I would sleep on the couch or in bed almost sitting up. Helped a lot for me. Not It’s fine when I lay down but I’m a month in a half sober
254,js3ipgk,comment,Longjumping_Rich_420,CHSinfo,1689447102,D8 and D10 sent me into a bad episode. Never had issues with CHS until a year after I smoked D8. I believe it’s the massive amounts of thc in them. Your body can’t metabolize it and it sticks to your receptors way quicker than regular flour. Same with dabs.
255,jrz5d8u,comment,Longjumping_Rich_420,CHSinfo,1689363747,A good chance it was the dyes in the Gatorade I’m on a month and a half of recovery and felt good the passed couple days and had a blue Powerade last night. Not down and out but my stomach def feels worse today. Everytime I drink Gatorade/Powerade it does it to me too. The dye and sugar is what I’m thinking. I’m sticking to lemon water or body armor and feel much better when I do. All dyes are bad but red 40 and Blue rosin 1 are the worst for gut inflammation. It’s actually banned overseas.

257,jrttp6n,comment,Longjumping_Rich_420,CHSinfo,1689269543,Same guy just under different account. I will say it doesn’t help and will probably be harder to get better quicker with overweight and no exercise due to thc being stored in fat. Stays in fat cells for 4-6 months after quitting if you’re not burning it off

My brother went through something like this for a couple days and it turned out to be a bad gas of gas. No joke. After like 3 days he felt a shift in his gut and it went away almost instantly. Give it a few days and stay hydrated. Go from there 👍🏼

264,jrgaija,comment,Longjumping_Rich_420,CHSinfo,1689022534,I agree but So is dying from dehydration
265,jrfh195,comment,Longjumping_Rich_420,CHSinfo,1689011181,It’s saline and Ativan most of the time. The reason for the iv isnt the difference in hydration source it is that it goes directly into the bloodstream. It’d much more difficult and would take much longer to drink all that fluid in saltwater or anything in that matter. Feeling like people to with chs to drink that much fluid to bring your hydration back is almost impossible. It’s the delivery method more than the actual fluid they use. You just can’t pump pedialyte straight into your bloodstream so saline is the ticket. Lol

268,jrav9qj,comment,Longjumping_Rich_420,CHSinfo,1688924911,Don’t listen to the silly goose that keeps telling everyone to just drink saltwater. Seen him in a few posts and is either not all there in the head or drank saltwater and somehow he made himself feel better. saltwater can be healthy in some facets but wrong mixture can lead to more vomiting an diarrhea. Went through the whole chs thing 3 times with lab tests showing potassium and electrolytes at normal levels and quitting weed altogether is what really started to subside the issues. Still only about a month and a half out but with no weed and clean eating I was able to manage after about 3 weeks. Stick to Gatorade (without red dye 40 or blue rosin 1) I stick the white Gatorade due to no coloring or a lemon water/cucumber mixture if you like that. Pedialyte is also packed with unhealthy additives but it could save you if you’re that dehydrated. Get the dehydration under control and then worry about the healthier aspect of it
269,jr3pcjt,comment,Longjumping_Rich_420,CHSinfo,1688780926,"Dang, I wish through the 7 doctors visits I went to for chs and 3 lab screenings I had (which showed my electrolytes at normal level) my doc would have just told me to drink saltwater and all my issues would have been cleared. Brilliant deduction 😂😂"
270,jqyzzc0,comment,Longjumping_Rich_420,CHSinfo,1688695348,But also keep in consideration. It seems everyone’s CHS reacts quite different. But one thing I do know is stomach inflammation increases panic and anxiety. So start there.
271,jqyyto6,comment,Longjumping_Rich_420,CHSinfo,1688694795,"Stay away from anything Fried 100% but also food dyes, high sugars, pepper, caffeine and definitely chocolates. Stay away from diet drinks as well. People say Gatorade, which if drinking that for hydration then that’s better than being dehydrated but try to stick to the white Gatorade as they don’t have the food dyes in them. I drink body armor because no dyes. Food dyes have direct correlation to inflammation of the brain and stomach. Red dye 40 and blue rosin 1 are the worst. Pedialyte contrary to doctors recommendations is not good to drink (but again better than dehydration) pedialyte is packed with artificial garbage that is directly correlated to inflammation. For me it was probably all the fried food and bottle of Jameson I drank. I eat to heal the quickest in the morning 2 bananas with honey and a cup of organic Greek yogurt. For lunch something light if anything at all and dinner I make a soup that consists of (organic bone broth, portobello mushrooms, garlic gloves whole, unseasoned chicken baked 3/4 in the oven and finished fully cooking in the boiling broth to completion, diced carrots and onion and oregano. With saltines ( a life saver ) I eat a lot of fish too during my flare ups but not fried. Just baked salmon or tilapia (tilapia is a bottom feeder fish though so not the healthiest just really cheap) if it seems boring to eat. Then you’re probably good to go lol also a good weight helping snack is ezekial bread, bananas, almond/peanut butter and organic honey. It’s like a dessert but very healthy in the midst of all the bad stomach feeling."
272,jqybmxl,comment,Longjumping_Rich_420,CHSinfo,1688684076,"I have been having the same. I’ve been clean from thc for over a month now cold turkey after have a bout at the end of may. Been eating extremely clean and haven’t touched alcohol. Felt almost back to normal the passed week and a half. Went to a Fourth of July party at a family campground and drank Jameson and ate fried food like there was no tomorrow. The day after I felt right back to square one. No vomiting but high heart rate on and off, feeling of anxiety and stress when I don’t have a need to be. Sweating of hands and feet and not much appetite. The triggers can act the exact same as the thc. My somewhat now educated guess would to be go 6 months clean from EVERYTHING that can trigger it. I felt so good the passed week I thought I was in the clear. But after a month I was indeed not in the clear. Be careful with it and you’ll be okay. Just don’t do what I did after a week of feeling good and think you can jump right back to it. Not the case with this. Prayers for a speedy recovery!"
273,jqyb0he,comment,Longjumping_Rich_420,CHSinfo,1688683808,"Mine took about 3 weeks to subside. Then I fell off the wagon with food and alcohol and it came back. I know the feeling. Impending doom, feeling worthless, scared to leave the house cause of panic attacks and a lot of anxiety and lethargy. It does go away just be very careful the next few months. I haven’t touched thc but the food and alcohol had the same effect so alcohol is not longer for me and I’m monitoring my food to the maximum. It does sucks but it gets better.

276,jnbwlc4,comment,Longjumping_Rich_420,CHSinfo,1686183670,You don’t need a crutch you’re stronger than that. I’m also on NIC as well. So through all this I’m also detoxing from Caffeine (2-3 Red Bulls a day) weed and nicotine. (Everyday for the past 5 years) It’s tough and I’m still hitting the nicotine but not as much to subside that a little. When I’m healthy that’ll be the final to go.

(2-3 joint a day guy + plus a bowl here and there) this is what I think is my second episode. Im blessed in the aspect of never wanting to touch the stuff again. Even my doc said I should try to ween and I told him I wasn’t going to. Dealing with cold turkey withdrawals sucks but the feeling of not knowing when you might be incapacitated for weeks is a much scarier thought to me. Get to a week then go from there. Your anxieties will start to clear and you can deal with them in a therapeutic manner instead of covering it up with weed. As I also have for many years. Stay strong 💪 prayers inbound 🤙🏽

281,jn1rbdm,comment,Longjumping_Rich_420,CHSinfo,1686005195,I can’t guarantee but would assume it’s because the burnt weed residue collects in the saliva and you swallow it leading to all the burnt thc and stuff just resting in your gut. That’s what builds up the nasty stuff and starts to hurt the receptors.
282,jmti18m,comment,Longjumping_Rich_420,CHSinfo,1685847402,A pastor once said that resonated with me that anxiety is your check engine light. When your check engine light comes on it isn’t because your motor blew up it’s because it’s compiled an amount of problems and it’s telling you to stop running that motor and figure out the issue. As a 7 year mechanic I can start that could not be more true.

Stress is so bad and so hard to deal with sometimes. I’m blessed to have a supportive family and my brother went through many episodes of panic attacks and depression. He’s got almost completely out of it by diet change, drinking fresh distilled water that doesn’t come in plastic and exercise. There will be physical ailments with this as well. But like he told me today. It’s all baby steps. Even if it lasts weeks do a little thing each day to chip away. Stress is a build up much like the THC on your receptors so when it hits. It hits HARD. But it will pass. I’m taking this as a lesson to stop medicating to cover my stress, because when something like this happens you have suppressed the stress for so long it’s a giant ball of mess that rears it’s ugly face to the full extent.

It’s been about 2 days now that I’m starting to feel more normal so fingers crossed this is working itself out 🤞 I know it easier said than done but eat as much as possible.

Nausea, heart palpitations, panic and sever dehydration. I finally got a diagnosis that it was the flu about 2 weeks into it. But I’m still not buying that it was just the flu. Been feeling fine since January 12th. Here I am going on June and I’m in the exact same boat. No appetite, severe dehydration, no fever, stomach constantly feels like it just isn’t digesting. I have taken a couple one hitter puffs the passed couple days thinking it was withdrawals as I’ve been trying to ween off. (So much for that) as smokers and those who wanna quit and are trying like me. We need to be advocates for those who think it’ll be completely harmless because it’s “natural” and honestly that’s what got me as well. I’m just as foolish. But I really feel like it’s up to us to help out those who can avoid this. Because I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy. Everyone dealing with this you are not alone. I’m a firm believer In Christ and that’s helped me a lot with the emotional aspect but I know not everyone is spiritual and I get that. It’s the only relief I’ve found and I’m praying for each and everyone one of us that fell into this trap."
298,t3_13xgyy2,post,Longjumping_Rich_420,CHSinfo,1685624424,Has anyone had CHS with all symptoms except vomiting?? I’m really trying to narrow down if this is CHS or not and going back to the doctor today. Been a week now of all symptoms except vomiting. Is it just me or anyone else??
299,t3_142xgj9,post,Longjumping_Rich_420,CHSinfo,1686095698,So I’ve been eating more (not a lot) but I’m also 4 days sober. Something I haven’t been in 4 years. At night I sweat like crazy and I wake up and weigh less than the day before. Is this natural with chs? Even off the weed? It’s like my metabolism is in overdrive and whatever I eat gets burned so fast. Thinking about heading back to the ER but not sure if there is even anything that will help with that. Sorry for the questions this is my first time dealing with CHS (I think) and I never want to touch weed again. Just don’t know how to heal if I can’t eat or sleep well 😩
300,j3tuxfz,comment,Longjumping_Rich_420,flu,1673398397,I’m right there with you. Had to go back to work 2 days ago and still feel like death. I was taking NyQuil every night and DayQuil during the day to ease my sinus issues. I never had a sore throat or fever through the whole thing. Did have some severe night sweats though for the first week and a half. The NyQuil didn’t help much but offered a small amount of relief. Just gets a little dangerous on the kidneys taking too much of that stuff. When I was in the ER they wrote me a doctors note and said they could only give me a 3 days max. I’m like are you kidding me. Luckily the owner of the place I work and I are friends so he worked with me a bit. Plus I do manual labor everyday so it’s even tougher. Hang in there you got this. Stock up on pedialyte or something with electrolytes. Too much water alone can be worse or even lead to hyponetremia. Take care of yourself my friend!
301,j3tr8fg,comment,Longjumping_Rich_420,flu,1673396885,"Dealing with the same thing on week 3, doctors have given me antibiotics and zofran when I went to the ER for dehydration. Note : I’ve NEVER been to the hospital for a flu. This is a different strand and you have to ride it out. No medication has work and the zofran actually increased my heart rate and cause more panic attacks than it helped. Tested negative for Covid but positive for influenza and viral infection. This is tough stuff but stay strong and Hydrated. Also if you’re on an SSRI and taking zofran for the nausea that could be making it worse. Which I didn’t know until recently so I stopped taking it and my rapid heartbeat has settled down."
302,j3ju9au,comment,Longjumping_Rich_420,flu,1673228589,Stick it out. I’m on week 3and a half. Some sort of new flu variant. TONS of people are having this without fever. Me included. Just gotta wait it out and stay hydrated. Pedialyte is your best friend. Too much water alone can lead to hyponatremia.

317,jt533d6,comment,anthropocene-,fashion,1690131320,Style is subjective!!! you look good just kinda immature and the outfit also doesn’t match itself. Looks randomized. I think if you wear an oversized black tee on top with like something on it or even plain and the same skirt. Same shoes or even high tops. Regular socks. Either low or just above the ankle. Some earrings. Hair looks good how it is cause it’s causal. Hope that helps. :)
318,jt4ndqm,comment,anthropocene-,fashion,1690124697,"No dude this outfit is pretty bad and none of it flows. If you’re old enough to be going out for a girls night then you should know that this outfit would be fine for a 12 year old and not you. I mean do you but if you’re asking for advice, a different shirt that isn’t tucked in and also has a different neckline. Literally anything but grey. The skirt is bad but if it’s your style then slay. Just wear a shirt that actually matches it. The socks are bad cause they are actually like those sheer socks that are supposed to go under trousers not be seen. So idk just wear like normal socks and those sneakers. And whatever shirt you choose DO NOT TUCK IT IN.  Tbh like a baggy black band tee shirt would look better. Overall though you’re gorgeous and should do whatever you want babe."

I don’t know when I started having the flu but it could’ve been any day last week maybe Monday. Which means I’ve had it for about eight days. It’s weird because usually when I get sick with the flu I get absolutely floored right away but I worked all last week and just felt a little more groggy in the mornings. And like I had cough and sneeze throughout the day, but I didn’t feel awful. And then Friday Saturday Sunday starting to pick up. Saturday was when I was like OK, wait yeah I think I’m sick. Like beyond a cold. And then Sunday I called out of work Monday I went to the doctor. They told me I had the flu after testing for flu and Covid. My Cough is so bad and as is the fatigue and muscle weakness. 


The doctor gave me a note to be out of work until the ninth so I think I’m just gonna take that and run with it. We have off on Friday for the Veterans Day anyway so I’ll just be out this whole week.  

Anyway, yes, this is gonna be my diary until I’m better lol gives me something to do besides read or go on YouTube






OK so I’m thinking today would be day like six and the fatigue was better today and the cough is better. Still have both. I think muscle weakness was also better. have a bit of a headache.  Could be due to coughing or whatever. I made fresh ginger tea in fresh turmeric tea, and drink a cup of each. Had Willow extract, echinacea, elderberry, zinc, and"

341,jlipmts,comment,anthropocene-,covidlonghaulers,1684985092,"
I just graduated in the fall semester. Biggest thing I could say is stop doing anything extra and only focus on School and resting when you can. Probably not able to study all night or anything like that and please don’t try it would be so much better for you to study until you feel you shouldn’t anymore and then just go to sleep.

What I did to help was I went to sleep as soon as I felt tired so it could be 6 PM and I would put your plugs and put my mask on and go to sleep no matter who is asking to hang out or anything.

I got all my work done and studying done at Efficiently as I could, stayed super hydrated and ate Super clean but enough  

I would recommend taking melatonin in the evening when you’re ready to sleep and waking up only when you need to. I had class at 9:30 so I would get up at nine to ensure I had as much time to sleep as I could. 


Sorry I went on a huge tangent basically rest as much as you can and do school as much as you feel you can. I still did work with friends but when I felt like I should go home I went home and rested. Don’t feel any pressure to socialize and party or anything because you can’t right now that’s OK. I know it’s hard to be in school and not be able to go out and do things but you’re on the homestretch just hang in there."

350,jj5wxc4,comment,anthropocene-,covidlonghaulers,1683426356,"This specific symptom is depression/ anxiety which is a result of the LC and the effect it’s had on your life. While it’s not “all in your head” this symptom specifically is psychological and can be greatly alleviated by therapeutic/meds/ both approaches. I used to be stuck feeling doom all the time and refused to take meds but once I got on Lexapro (and got to the right dosage) I’m genuinely ok mentally even though physically I’m a wreck. 

I highly recommend working on the mental aspect of this. Acceptance and commitment to yourself and your health as well as considering talking to a Dr about getting on an SSRI or something to aid in alleviating your overall suffering. If you feel better mentally, you can work on feeling better physically."

Sleeping 12+ hours a night
Electrolytes
Drinking enough water
eating a really whole foods esqu diet
No gluten 
Otc vitamins

367,jcwxftn,comment,anthropocene-,covidlonghaulers,1679287337,"There aren’t tiers to this illness. If you have long-term effects after your Covid infection, you have long Covid. Like I said in another comment maybe in a few years there will be discernible timelines and intensities of symptoms for diagnoses of different degrees of this illness. And who are you to say that anybody is making any of it up, that makes you just as bad as doctors who won’t believe patients. In every medical community there’s people that don’t belong there but maybe they don’t even know that. Anyway, what I’m trying to say is someone could live a perfectly normal life but have lingering symptoms from their Covid infection. They can have new intolerances, daily headaches, maybe even other invisible issues… But it’s not as intense as others Who are bed-bound and such."
368,jcwx2e0,comment,anthropocene-,covidlonghaulers,1679287089,"I there are different levels to long Covid. we don’t have the Termanology to discern what is what yet. So if somebody has effects from their Covid infection that last for a few months … who’s to say that that doesn’t count? Maybe soon there Will be distinct categories and timelines for diagnoses. But for right now just because you’ve been suffering for 17 months and haven’t recovered doesn’t mean that someone who has recovered earlier isn’t authentic or that their suffering isn’t justified. For example both me and my friend have dealt with post concussive syndrome, she hasn’t recovered fully yet and it’s been five years. I did recover, twice, and it did not take any longer than a year both times. You only know what you are going through, and you don’t even know that very well because who does? I don’t mean to totally go off on you or anything and I only wish you recover because this illness fucking sucks but I don’t know just post one of the comments just really rubbed me the wrong way I felt like I had to say something.

I don't know how I'm gonna get through these next few weeks of school, papers, finals, etc and pack and move home. 

then, I dont know how im gonna start working somewhere when I feel awful most of the time. and my family doesn't even know im dealing with longCovid.

557,k8j3wo3,comment,Pleasant-Corgi1450,flu,1699552519,I’m glad they helped you out with that. It may just be upper respiratory. I managed to get myself dressed and called my husband home from work to help with the kids and get them all to the urgent care. We’re FLU B positive. Today is day 2 and It’s BEEN awful. Called in tamiflu I hope I can get it in us by tomorrow cause if day 3 is the worst. I can’t imagine getting worse than this. We’re about to rest too. Get you some rest and I’m glad it turned out not to be any of the bad stuff.

562,k8h7dvl,comment,Pleasant-Corgi1450,flu,1699518522,"Probably wouldn’t hurt to go get tested for all of the things. I didn’t test positive for covid until day 3 and idk if it’s too late for you to get tamiflu if your positive for that. 

We’re on day 1/2 it’s 3:26 here. My brother tested positive for flu b and I have 4 out of 6 kids down. One vomiting and they’re running hella fevers. 

We had covid a month ago. Only one of us ran a fever. Seems as though with flu you run one vs covid a lot don’t. I’d definitely get tested tomorrow for both. I’ve been doing Tylenol and ibuprofen every 2 hours. Hope you feel better soon."

575,k7qsqhs,comment,Pleasant-Corgi1450,Vent,1699067764,You need to report her. Can you tell your counselor at school? Or your doctor? Maybe a family member that could help? She’s medically neglecting you and that’s illegal in the US. It’s not safe for you to stop medication for anxiety like that.

And I know it’s anxiety I KNOW i need the medication but something keeps telling me it’s not anxiety and it’s something else taking the Zoloft will mask that and I’ll never get to the root cause. I do take metoprolol ER (which is a beta blocker) cause like you I have super bad tachycardia. It took me over a month of my heart rate being 150+ to start that. It’s just all so scary. I’m keeping my fingers crossed and sending you good vibes that the treatment you’re doing now helps. 💕💕

The pharmacist freaked me out. Apparently, it’s not a great idea to mix it with metoprolol. Day 2 has been my worst day. My body aches have been horrid. Cough has been pretty bad but slacking up now. Besides that a Stopped up nose, waves of chest pain and fatigue have been my main symptoms. My first symptom was a scratchy/sore throat but that got better by day 3. The doctor tonight told me that being I had my first 2 shots and covid back in 2021 I had some immunity and should be totally fine riding it out. However, he still prescribed paxlovid as a precaution. Have you had covid at all?"

I’m like ok does this mean I’m on the mend or ? I saw someone say they felt ok one day and then boom they felt bad the next. It’s so frustrating.

I can’t think or focus, fatigue, dizzy lightheaded, on the verge of panic and I feel like I’m in a dream like state. Like now I just got up off the bed and I’m so dizzy and lightheaded can’t focus and feel almost as if I’m drunk or high. It gives me a headache and at times I even feel like my vision is whacky. My friend mentioned depersonalization but I’m not familiar with it much. Usually, this lasts a few minutes but lately, it’s lasting hours. I’ve checked my BP it’s good, pulse and oxygen are good, and sugar is also good. It keeps me in a constant panic because I have the worst health anxiety. I'm considering going to a mental health hospital here tomorrow. I just hate to mask my symptoms with SSRIs if it’s hormones related. All this started at PP when I had my son back in 2020. My question is does anyone else have these symptoms? I seriously feel like I’m losing my mind. I’m a mom of 6 and I just need to get better. This is an awful way to live."

As to the other persons comment it really would suck to be in another country with Covid and your body definitely could use the rest to battle it better. So it’s a rather tough decision you have there! Very smart on the travel insurance, if you have time I would just wait a little longer and try testing yourself again before your travel plans and if you’re still positive then cancel?   My thoughts still is “life needs to go on”. I was fricken stir crazy after doing the 5 day quarantine. And I did go out in a mask after the 5 days but I made sure to wash hands and stay clear of people. So I understand wanting to go on with plans completely. As long as you are smart about it. :)"

I was never a JEEP person until I got a gladiator. When I saw the concept for it before it was officially released. I fell in love with the look granted my family has had wranglers for years decades even I definitely am a JEEP person now after having my gladiators , this is my second gladiator, so I guess you won’t really know unless you do or don’t get one lol I will add in that I have had a Silverado before it was a 2014 that I bought brand new and personally for me. I like the gladiator way better I’m not really a full-size pick up kind of person I don’t need a full-size pick up either. The Silverado was huge feeling but the gladiator to me doesn’t feel small either, it has a generous amount of room especially on the inside compared to the other midsize trucks. If I’m not mistaken, I believe the gladiator might be the number one with the most room from a video I saw on YouTube I could be wrong so don’t quote me on that, but if you don’t need a full-size truck and like the idea of having a convertible pick up, then I would say go for it"

I did have a fever for a day and a half, but even after my fever broke, I still felt like I had a fever, but my temperature was normal and that lasted a couple days, I feel very fortunate because I got rid of both in about nine days. I only lost my smell for three days as soon as my smell came back on day nine I tested for Covid again and it was negative and I’ve been fine ever since I hope you and your familyrecover sooner rather than later Covid can be so random for everyone.

Like sitting in front of a fan or air conditioner. It really does help and is better than eating something. Give it a try!

743,k6qlqiu,comment,SageFreke86,COVID19positive,1698442531,Thanks I appreciate the kind words. I think once my 10 days are up and I get back my regular routine it will slowly get better. I haven’t seen anyone or socialized in 8 days
744,k6ql1dr,comment,SageFreke86,COVID19positive,1698442245,I had flu and Covid and honestly don’t know what my symptoms were for. I had diarrhea for a day and nausea but no vomiting
745,k6qki01,comment,SageFreke86,COVID19positive,1698442025,I’ve been on an SSRI for over 5 years now   Might try to take some supplements. Don’t wanna risk seretonin syndrome either though 😅   It’s also going to be my TOTM soon so could be pms
746,k6pvrdh,comment,SageFreke86,COVID19positive,1698432748,It was gone in 2 days for me
747,k6phka5,comment,SageFreke86,COVID19positive,1698427530,I had random shooting ear pains that was on and off for 2 days but I also had Covid and flu so it could have just been like stress etc. it was in my temples too
748,k6pfu5x,comment,SageFreke86,flu,1698426904,YES! So all week I had/have the flu B and Covid. The first like 2 days I was sick I was peeing LIKE CRAZY! All night I would get up every 2 hours to pee and I wasn’t even drinking anything.  A family member caught the flu as well and same exact thing. They had a day/night where they barely drank and just peed constantly. For me though I actually did have a UTI. But the peeing is definitely from the flu too
749,k6pfjwa,comment,SageFreke86,COVID19positive,1698426799,Thanks! Yes it was only gone for 3 days so hopefully that’s a good thing and this virus is almost gone. Fingers crossed 🤞

751,k6pf8ka,comment,SageFreke86,COVID19positive,1698426685,Luckily my sense of smell came back today and that cheered me up a lot. So it’s something atleast!! Thank you 💜
752,k6pevrq,comment,SageFreke86,COVID19positive,1698426555,Indeed 🥲😅. It’s been a hell of a week. Finally starting to slightly feel normal again. I still get fatigued if I’m out walking around for too long. So just been trying to take it easy for the most part. It’s been quite a plummit on my mental health as well.
753,k6ow1nf,comment,SageFreke86,COVID19positive,1698419657,I’m on day 8 Covid and flu B and I lost my sense of smell for 3 days. It just came back today
754,k6mfyqu,comment,SageFreke86,COVID19positive,1698370374,That’s what I feel is going on for me.  The first 6 days were respiratory and now it’s 💩 and the respiratory is mostly gone at this point. I haven’t regained my loss of smell yet though.

Started having the Covid diarrhea today after a week of respiratory symptoms and found myself even more depressed with these new GI symptoms. Also period is SUPPOSED to start in 4 days so could be pms. I also have PMDD and PCOS.  I feel your pain.i feel hopeless and like I will never get better and it’s terrifying. First time having Covid too.

766,k6jfqjn,comment,SageFreke86,emetophobia,1698329178,Covid and the flu are going around like crazy right now too.  I currently have both. If it happens it happens. We have to remind ourselves it’s a part of life.
767,k6j8ake,comment,SageFreke86,COVID19positive,1698326103,So I have flu/covid and both me and a family member who caught it were peeing like every hour or 2 despite not really drinking. It went on for like 2 days

For me right now I’m terrified of dry cough leading to tu*. From coughing so much. Happened to me when I was a kid and it traumatized me for sure lol. Luckily even with having both flu and Covid rn my symptoms have been very mild. My worst day was the first night/following morning. I had extremely severe body aches and headache. Now I just have mild congestion and feel like I’m getting better already

East GR has surprisingly turned into a liberal area and also has excellent schools. If you can find a home in the “Golden Triangle” you will get GR Township taxes and East GR schools.

976,jxd0c33,comment,Mom2MittenState,fearofflying,1692757769,Not in the industry. But anxiety will make you fixate on these random things and convinces you that seeing them must mean something! It’s basically like the news scrolling at the bottom of the screen stops - that’s your brain on anxiety. You pull into those stories because the anxiety makes them a higher priority and more important. Hopefully this makes sense.

986,jwuhukh,comment,Mom2MittenState,Anxiety,1692445319,"I would recommend going to your primary doctor, getting on anxiety meds and also getting into therapy to help you deal with the health anxiety. You’ll learn coping mechanisms.
But - the one crap thing about anxiety is you’re always questioning if the pains (or insert whatever health issue here) are real or fake, and what if you miss the real health issue? I get where you’re coming from but definitely take steps to address the anxiety."

999,jwklv0p,comment,Mom2MittenState,Amtrak,1692278193,"We just did the Empire Builder 2 weeks ago. We were severely delayed by a freight train derailment which required us to be bussed from the bustling metropolis of Staples, Minnesota to Fargo, North Dakota. Only positive was the amazing scenery we saw through Glacier and Idaho which normally would be at night for the westbound trains.
We also ended up on a bus from Spokane to Portland because they terminated service in Spokane.
Now, we went with the flow, didn’t complain and rolled with the situation. Made for an adventure and clearly it was outside of Amtrak’s control.

What I will say is that the trains are dirty, they are old, and for what we paid for a roommette I wouldn’t do it again until they get new Superliners. The pillows were junk, wasn’t even sure if I had a clean blanket, the air conditioning in the car we were in didn’t work that well so me, who normally is cold, was even sweating it out.  The second day I took a shower early and there was no hot water. Thought my traveling companion was kidding as he loves a super hot shower but it was icy cold.

Amtrak needs better equipment. Clean the trains good - inside and out! Windows were filthy and the sightseer lounge was gross on the walls and windows. 

For the price paid; which was more than flying, I expected a little nicer. The flight home was luxurious in comparison and I was in coach."

I have seen very aggressive panhandling and try to walk people to ATMs, and even if I said I didn’t have cash I’d have people tell me to go into a the restaurant I came from to order them something.
I also had these little punch cards from Degage they could use for a meal or shower or other things and people never wanted them, just the cash. Each card was worth $2 so if they needed the services they would have taken them.
The underlying social issues need to be addressed, and maybe some non-religious shelters need to be opened. But, I do think the city needs to curb aggressive panhandling, because it does exist."

1021,jtek56i,comment,Mom2MittenState,grandrapids,1690303136,"EGR, while definitely mid-to-upper class, is liberal leaning and has a strong sense of community. Schools are excellent thus property value is retained. 
Forest Hills would be the same with mid-to-upper class folks, excellent schools as well. The geographic area is larger so you have 3 high schools as well. There are plenty of pockets with normal middle class folks in Forest Hills; it’s not all mansions by any stretch of the imagination. You can live in older homes and remodel, update your landscaping and be totally fine. There’s a big push to learn about DEI and I’d say the area is definitely leaning more blue than ever…let’s call it purple. Heck, even Gretchen Whitmer went to Forest Hills Central. If you’re looking for an active community, you’ll find it here. Just not as compact as EGR.  
People have a perception of both places but I think they’re both super nice.

in this forum for sharing helpful tips and coping mechanisms. I did take my pill but that doesn’t erase the intense panic and dread for me on a plane. Anytime we had turbulence, I kept saying bumps in the road, bumps in the road over and over. I also paid attention to other passengers who were acting completely normal. I kept repeating to myself that I pilots want to get home safely too. 
I did sit next to the wing so hopefully that helped minimize any turbulence but I am proud of myself for getting on the plane! 
I did sit in the middle seat between my hubby and kiddo so that helped plus I have my trusty blanket I take for travel. I also put on a podcast about eliminating stress and closed my eyes, squeezed my blanket and before I knew it, we were landing! :) 
To all of you: You can do this!!! I’ve had flight anxiety for 20 years (not sure what triggered it) and I love to go places but hate flying with a passion. Get.On.That.Plane."

1029,jszmk9z,comment,Mom2MittenState,grandrapids,1690027731,"I agree with your sentiment about people’s home standards. Or standards in general. I know when we started out with our first home almost 20 years ago we had no cable, rarely ate out, etc to focus on paying off student loans and car loans. However, we were able to move into a highly rated school district into a normal sized home and have remodeled to make it our own. 
We’ve often chatted, especially recently, how people can afford a house and how much our home would cost us now if we just bought instead of a decade ago. 
I do think, while it’s definitely not everything, that people need to learn budgeting and the concept of needs vs wants. Morning coffee might be a need, but Starbucks is a want. Pack a lunch for work. One streaming service instead of 3. You don’t need the latest iPhone or other gadget. Little changes can really add up."

 -low fat turkey sandwiches 
Sourdough bread from Whole Foods, turkey breast deli meat, homemade honey mustard, tomatoes and spinach.

-granola bars

-rice cooked in fat free chicken broth

2 1/2 years ago I started having a burning pain starting slightly right of my sternum all the way wrapping around to my back, like you said. 
I went to my NP and she guessed it was ulcers, gave me a PPI and antacids that didn’t help a bit. 
Fast forward to a month ago, I started having more stabby pains in the same area, along with the burning. Went to the ER twice and turns out I had gallstones. 
Saw a surgeon and within a week I had surgery to remove my gallbladder. I’m now 4 days post op."

And it’s especially not a very solid identity if it can be so shaken by someone else disagreeing with it.
Gender ideology is built on shaky ground because there’s no reality to it. It’s based off of people’s feelings and twisted stereotypes of what they think a woman/man is. 

If someone with ab eating disorder was harming themselves, and truly believed they were overweight when in fact, they were not, would we just go along with it and not say anything because it might hurt their feelings? No. That would be the most unloving thing to do for them. 
It’s the same with this. 

Affirming their delusion is not the way to let them know they’re loved. There are other ways of doing that without enabling.

I texted my boss today letting her know I wouldn’t be in, and explained why. I couldnt even use the restroom by myself. She never texted me back. This was 3 hours before my shift. 

She still didn’t say anything closer to my shift so I let a supervisor know. She did text back thanking me for letting her know and told me to feel better. 

I saw the chiropractor today &amp; was diagnosed with the sprain and given a note for the day off. I told him I could only take one day. 

I sent the note to my boss &amp; she said nothing. 

Even now at the end of the day I updated her on how I was feeling &amp; she still hasn’t responded. 

What gives??"

This parent is my mom, and without going into pages and pages of details of what she did and continues to do to me and the people around me, just know I’m 31 years old and this woman is still haunting my every move and now it’s affecting my husband and my daughter. I’m done. I’m an adult and I’m tired of being treated like she treats me, I’m tired of hearing her lies, her lying about me, her talking sh*# about me and my family members to me and my husband, I’m tired of feeling so angry and anxious. 

I fear going no contact will be difficult because she’s my daughters grandmother, but I recently saw her treat her the way she used to treat me as a kid and I don’t want that for my kid. Maybe she’d be better off without her? My therapist tells me if I don’t want her in my life, to cut her off and there’s nothing wrong with that. 

Because she has never taken any accountability for her actions, has never successfully made it through a sit down with me or let me express my feelings without deflecting, lying, or blowing up, my husband has suggested to tell her that I don’t want her to contact us anymore, and if we want to, we will contact her. 

There’s going to be family fall out no matter what, I just need advice or to hear your stories of what worked for you.

She took the sample and it’s being sent off for results but I won’t get those for about a week. 

When I asked what I should do or what could cause this she mentioned STDs, which I wouldn’t have, my partner and I are monogamous and have been together for twelve years, it could be HPV pre cancerous cells or straight up cancer. 

I’m so worried, I don’t know what else could cause this but I’m going crazy already and how I’ll wait a week for the results of my pap I don’t know. Has anyone else gone through this?"

When I was 9, I got into a bike accident at the skate park. When I went to the dentist after the accident and the ER, nothing was done except I THINK the guy gave my parent a treatment plan but my parent was really neglectful &amp; she never got me any further assistance or appointments, stating we couldn’t afford it (but she always had money for her trips and stuff)

Fast forward to now,  I’m 30 years old. I haven’t ever had stable dental insurance. When I HAVE seen a dentist they comment on the underbite, but one has told me that if they were to fix the front teeth that got pushed back from the impact of hitting my face on the concrete, they would just fall out. Another one commented on it when I was getting a different procedure done but I couldn’t go back as I lost my dental insurance. 
[teeth](https://imgur.com/a/LSe5rOp)
It’d be part of my mental health healing journey to fix this, but I just don’t know how or where to start or if it’s even fixable.

Here’s what’s gonna happen, OP: 

1) She might get back to you whenever she wants and slowly tell you about the other men she tried seeing during the “break” which will break you to a point of no repair. 

2) She will never come back but won’t let you date anyone else too because she won’t be sure herself if she wants to come back or not. 

In both the situations, you will suffer. 

The right thing to do here would be - communicate with her regarding the boundaries during this “break” of hers and tell her that you also have an equal part in this relationship, you don’t wanna be hanging in the middle - so another conversation with more rules would be better. And you’ll also get an idea about what exactly is she thinking through her body language/tone of voice.

When I went to my Psychiatrist, he looked at my diagnosis (he suggested me to get diagnosed so that the medications can be given according to the diagnosis), he shrugged the diagnosis saying “see, it’s ONLY BPD. Then what is the reason of having such severe breakdowns. You have to work on yourself in therapy, along with medicines.” 

And ever since, I started feeling that BPD is just nothing? It’s not even a disorder per say. It’s just stupid. It took me 3 years to come out of denial and actually start working on it and realising how big of a deal is it and how badly have I suffered throughout my life. 

I did not need my Psychiatrist’s validation after all.

1555,t3_17581h3,post,CookieFlirtyDough,heartbreak,1697008338,"I (27F) met a guy (29M) early September. Everything was magical and he treated me well. He took care of my emotional needs and was always there when I needed emotional support. Things were moving rather “too” quickly and my family also warned me about it saying “Don’t go too fast, don’t wanna see you get hurt.” 

Today, it’s been two days since he decided that he needed “space”. We used to sleep together on video calls every night and suddenly that’s gone. We used to text/call the entire day and knew each others’ whereabouts. Now that’s gone. He called me last night though, to ask for help as his payment wasn’t getting through and he needed to pay for his cab (it was a legit situation). But ever since, he has been unreachable again. 

Couple of things which happened during this month: 

- He moved to my vicinity, I arranged everything for him. From finding the apartment till settling in. 
 
- He demanded a lot of time from me, and I gave him all my attention, keeping all of the other stuff/work aside - like a fool. 

- Whenever I demand the same, he has been unable to show emotions or be there emotionally like he used to. 

- Yesterday, I was at his place and he served lunch for himself and ate it. I know it’s not a big thing but it was a huge deal for me as I did not eat anything (because he fought with me a night prior) and he did not even ask me if I would like to have lunch (that’s basic courtesy). On the other hand, he has managed to eat really nicely at my place, a lot many times and a lot many meals (I don’t regret it). 

There is a lot more but I think I’m experiencing trauma and my already existing trauma wounds are being re-ignited.

I keep thinking about fame and how to get famous. I don’t think about the money which I’m required to earn but just the fame part. 

I am on a right path right now, completing a degree which was long due in a field I’m most passionate about. But whenever I watch something - I keep thinking about switching my field and put all of my efforts and somehow just get very famous. I keep thinking fame is what I want. 

But then whenever I have acted on this impulse, I have never succeeded. I have failed businesses, a successful music career and now finally when I’m at the right path of having a stable job in some months, my impulse is coming back again. 

Rather than focusing on my work tasks, I go into day dreaming and become very excited as to how will I get that fame and power?

There was so much pain in leaving the trauma bonded abusive relationship &amp; take a stand for myself (cause I never did that before) - and now that I’m out of it, there is so much pain involved in learning to exist alone. 

“I wanna go back, oh he used to abuse you, maybe he’ll change, you gave him another chance, I dont know how to be alone, you were alone with him too.” These thoughts keep running in my head 24/7. I’m tired of the contradiction happening in my brain. 

Before you say anything, I’m already in therapy. But sometimes you cannot explain what you’re actually going through, specifically in such complex trauma.

I miss the old me, I want a new me. But I’m stuck romanticising an abusive relationship."
1605,t3_13r1pws,post,CookieFlirtyDough,abusiverelationships,1684971581,"Hi everyone! I have been vocal about my abusive relationship over this thread before as well, but what’s new is - I (26 F) managed to get out of the abusive relationship with my ex-partner (30 M). It’s been two months since I left him and now it hurts a tiny bit less. 

I am in therapy and I mostly talk about him and the patterns I follow, in order to not repeat them again. But I realised that I have been in denial about one specific topic - *the sexual abuse* 

Why am I not able to talk about it? Because I have not been able to talk about it even with myself till now. I think I’m deeply traumatised. 

Alright, I am gonna give you some details - maybe some of you will resonate with it (and I’m sorry if you do). 

1. The sex felt forced. For example, we would have a really bad fight from 9 pm till 12 am, I would cry a lot many times in between and by 12 am he would try to diffuse the situation (gaslight me about it) for 30 minutes. Then I would tell him that I’m mentally exhausted and I need to sleep, to which he would say of course. But the moment I would fall asleep, he would initiate sex from the back. I would tell him no multiple times but he would keep on initiating foreplay till the time I would just turn over and open my legs. Sometimes, I would just wait for him to finish, literally not even open my eyes. I would not get wet, but he would say “I like it when its so tight” instead of noticing that I’m not wet and it’s giving me rashes. So, I would just wait for him to finish - just so that I could sleep. 

2. He would start grinding me in the morning, now he had a morning job so he naturally woke up early but I used to study till late &amp; I was recovering from an illness as well, so I slept in till at least 11 am. He would start grinding me at 8 am, regardless of how many times I said no. He would keep on doing that till the time he was done. I tried to talk to him during the day multiple times, to which he always created a scene and said “you don’t want me to do it in the night and you don’t want me to do it in the morning either” - while he was still doing it both the times. 

3. Weekends were the worst. He would ask me to spend the whole weekend at some property and I did do that for a very long time. He just wanted to smoke up and have sex for those two days EVERY WEEK. I was tired of it. I had to finish up other work over the weekend but I was lacking behind cause he would create a scene if I said no to going out. And towards the end of it, I started hating the idea of weekends itself. 

4. He would “sex talk” really bad things. Like he would say things like “I want my girl to be very open with me” and then go on to talk like “oh I wanna see you have sex with other men” and continue on these lines while being in bed with me. I expressed my uneasiness to him, but that didn’t stop him. It was very sadistic. I’m unable to express it fully. 

I have a lot more to say but again, I’m unable to remember it right now because of the trauma response. 

I’m so proud of myself that I was at least able to face this much today."
1606,t3_11d0rkq,post,CookieFlirtyDough,abusiverelationships,1677466351,"*Background: In an abusive relationship since past 1.5 years. Going through therapy in order to leave safely. The process is still ongoing and my therapist thinks it’s still unsafe because my own patterns and trauma bonding will make me go back to him. So we are taking baby steps.*

So on Saturday, I ended things with this person because he mocked me about my weight. I got mad and I stood up to him, calling him out. Because of therapy, I have gotten to a point where I stand up for myself in front of him, when things get out of hands and he certainly doesnt like it. On Sat, he got mad and hung up the call on me. 

The rest of the day - I felt free. I went to a support group meeting on my own (he has made me very dependent on him) so going on my own is a big thing for me. After that, I went for dinner with my mom, came back home and watched my favourite series and loved every bit of it. Slept peacefully too. 

On Sunday, the entire day I was in bed. Tbh I was enjoying the freedom and still doing the things which I like because he would never let me. In the night this person starts to message and apologise, when I tell him that I’m leaving - he goes “I’m not letting you push me away, and I’m not letting you give up on us.” 

Now by this time I have taken my prescribed sleeping medication (for anxiety) and I’m drowsy but he calls me and says all that good stuff again. Idk what happened but we hung up the call saying I love you again. My Ily was very forced cause he was basically forcing me to say it. 

I don’t wanna be with him. But I dont know how to and what to do. I feel stuck. I’m scared of him. I’m scared to meet him. He is pushing me to meet him today even though I told him multiple times that I have a support group meeting (typically manipulative narc). I’m really scared of maintaining boundaries on my own. Idk what to do."

Everyone wants something from you, there were no selfless relationships in my life and maybe that’s why I kept on making my circle smaller, but it’s so damn lonely now.

Cause they get rejected on daily basis, in every aspect of their lives. Healthy is nothing but having happy cells in our body. How can they be happy when people don’t think they are worthy even? 

Anyway, I get your point of discipline and that you get inspired by the gym going “healthy” girls. But it’s not right to say that all obese people have bad stamina or endurance. They still give birth and many of them are single mothers as well. Weight has nothing to do with being disciplined."

At first, I was relieved that a doctor has finally been able to diagnose my condition as I went to millions of dermatologists in last 7 years, nobody told me it was Sebderm. They kept on giving me new anti-dandruff solutions and shampoos. Nothing ever worked. My eyebrows got affected, along with my ears and my face. But I’m happy that I’m finally diagnosed. 

Now, the derma has given me a steroid to put on my scalp for 2 weeks, along with a good anti-fungal shampoo. It has been working well from 9 days. I am hopeful that things will get better. I know it cannot be cured but I’m hoping to manage it well. 

Oh and also, my derma told me that everything is connected with the foods I eat and the intolerance. She asked me to turn vegan and gave me hope that plant based diet can do wonders improve inflammation. I won’t say it has been a walk on a cake, but it’s my 9th day into the vegan lifestyle as well.

I know all this is wrong. I know. I just want the survivors to tell me what are the small steps which I can take which will help me get out of this.

1657,t3_10vswh4,post,CookieFlirtyDough,BPD,1675745175,"Hi everyone. I got diagnosed with BPD in 2019, while I have been on anxiety and depression medications since 2017. 

My life was never a normal life and after my diagnosis I went into denial for a very long time, thinking this cannot be it. Only recently have I started to accept it and trying to catch hold of my symptoms. Thought i’ll write them down here and you can tell me if it’s all related to BPD or something else might be getting mixed too? (Although, chances are less) 

- I am very impulsive. 
- I overthink about every literal thing. 
- I cut ties with my close ones when they say something which I disapprove of. I block them out of my life. Cause of which I think I’m left with no friends. 
- The constant battle with food. I binge eat, I have been doing this since the age of 13 and I’m 26 now. I just cannot control binging. Like it’s just not happening. I think I get on some sort of a diet/intuitive eating/adding method every single month but I fail after 7-8 days while giving myself excuses. 
- The pattern of degrading myself in a relationship. I just forget myself when I’m in a relationship. Even if it’s an abusive one, I cannot leave. Co-dependency is so much that I just lose myself when I decide to walk away. I have not seen a good example at my home or my friends, maybe that also contributes. 

I am at a stage where I feel like everything is my fault and I cannot heal. 

Also, I’m in therapy from last 1.5 years and on medication too. While I have learnt to manage some of my impulsive thoughts, I still feel nothing’s working out and I feel helpless. I don’t feel like I’m ever gonna be capable of having a baby or creating my own family, and where I am from, a lot of emphasis is given on this. 

Nothing makes sense."

I don’t know anything about gun laws. If they could have purchased them legally why did they bring her? And why were there charges to Mark for selling to the under age?
1873,k6btd52,comment,shannon830,Columbine,1698193913,"Yes but she purchased the guns knowing they were being given to a minor.

We only have so much taped footage of Eric and Dylan and many of us have watched it numerous times over the years trying to find something. Trying to pinpoint a reason they ended up where they did, trying to compare them to ourselves or our friends, amazed at how normal they seem at times. Seeing the places where these recordings take place is interesting because it takes a catastrophic and highly publicized event and reminds us that this is just an ordinary town with ordinary people where something crazy happened.   That’s for me anyway. I don’t want to speak for anyone. I’m basically the same age as E/D for reference so it really hit home when all this happened."

Before you know it you will be feeling better. Also, I thought I had a flu a few months back and it turns out it was covid. I panicked when I found out but it wasn’t that bad.

She could have easily disappeared from her home after he left. Philadelphia to NC is quite a distance. I don’t believe she traveled there willingly. I also feel like if she had some sort of mental break she wouldn’t have gotten that far either. Anything is possible but I lean to either a planned hit and that person was paid to dispose of her that far away, or someone somehow tricked her into a car and kidnapped/killed her.

Did she mean earlier that evening? It always sounded like she meant after she returned from writing her letters. That really couldn’t be if lights were out and everything closed down.

1946,jmx7iqo,comment,shannon830,ColbyRichards,1685920280,"To the moron who just blocked me: You’ve obviously never had a close experience with a mental health crisis and it shows. This is very typical of a mental break/psychosis and if that’s what it was, and seems to be as it was reported he is inpatient, he will be out of work for a while. Since he just recently started they likely won’t be paying much if anything, in leave. You’re posting all over to bring awareness to this so called fake GFM. I didn’t donate so I don’t care if or how they use the money. If you donated they said you can be refunded so what is your issue? Did you donate and can’t get your money back? You seem obsessed with a random missing person case and are obviously clueless when it comes to mental health.  Get a life."
1947,jmx5szn,comment,shannon830,ColbyRichards,1685919472,You obviously can’t comprehend. He went to the hospital. No you know what?? I’m sure he hid out for a week and faked dehydration and everything else. I’m sure he fooled all of the medical staff. I’m sure he and his wife did all this to make 10k off of GFM. The article stated he was being treated inpatient. Learn how to read moron.
1948,jmti0sw,comment,shannon830,ColbyRichards,1685847395,"This man was found and taken to an inpatient facility. He was evaluated by the hospital. They can very easily tell if he’s dehydrated/malnourished. They also were doing a MH evaluation as they said he was not in his right mind. How is anyone even questioning this at this point? The man had a mental breakdown and ran off in the early morning (likely not having slept the night before) and basically went into hiding. I’ve had close family in psychosis and this is what I said all along with this case. There is no way for him to be faking out ER physicians and psychiatrists. He didn’t have to have a history of mental illness and his wife likely didn’t notice anything highly unusual if she wasn’t actively looking for it. If you’ve never experienced this I can tell you none of what happened with him surprises me in the least. This wasn’t a set up, a cash grab or anything like that."
1949,jmp5osh,comment,shannon830,ColbyRichards,1685761531,I highly doubt he is in his right mind. Someone in psychosis can be paranoid and hide. They also can have very little appetite. As long as he was able to get some water somewhere I assume he was in hiding. They said they are giving him medical and mental health treatment before questioning. This tells me it was a mental break of some kind and yes likely malnourished and dehydrated at this point.
1950,jmof7aw,comment,shannon830,ColbyRichards,1685748164,Found alive! No details yet!

1952,jmne0tt,comment,shannon830,ColbyRichards,1685732319,"Just from a totally outside looking in perspective, given all I’ve read, I keep going back to a mental break. I’ve had this happen to a close family member. They didn’t disappear but I could definitely see that happening. The new baby, two young kids, change in career to a job that seems way different than coaching, being the “main source of income “, all can be a lot of pressure on someone. Perhaps he didn’t like this new career (speculation) and felt stuck due to finances. All of this can lead to a psychosis, though not super common. If he was in a bad mental state he could be paranoid and hiding, he could not know who he is, lots of things. Hopefully they keep checking hospitals, homeless shelters, public places he could hide and blend in. He’s had to have had contact with someone at this point because he would have had to get water and food (although those in a psychosis can go long periods without feeling hungry). I hope they can piece his previous days together. Was he sleeping more or less, not showering, eating less, changing habits, etc. Hoping they get answers very soon."
1953,jmk6jjg,comment,shannon830,AshaDegree,1685671111,It really is weird. I don’t get it. That’s why I started blocking people. Too much time on their hands. I can’t go back and forth with those with that mentality.
1954,jmk6beg,comment,shannon830,AshaDegree,1685671007,I agree with this as well.
1955,jmj8bll,comment,shannon830,MissingPersons,1685656050,Yes. These news articles have been terrible.
1956,jmj27p1,comment,shannon830,MissingPersons,1685653621,Yeah it leads up to a road. Did he get into someone’s car? I really have a feeling he had some mental break and is not in his right mind. People who go into a psychosis can do things like this. Honestly at this point I hope that’s what it is and someone located him to get him help. So sad.
1957,jmj1v2b,comment,shannon830,ColbyRichards,1685653482,True on the weekend. I read their explanation. I don’t know to be honest. Pure speculation could be they were not in great shape financially and any missed time could really impact them? I really don’t know.
1958,jmiqh9p,comment,shannon830,MissingPersons,1685649184,[Here is the article mentioning it](https://www.fox26houston.com/news/colby-richards-missing-the-woodlands.amp)
1959,jmipfzi,comment,shannon830,ColbyRichards,1685648795,"I’m replying to why he wouldn’t have a salary. If he’s not working he’s not getting paid. As far as the go fund me, I can’t speak to that. I know early on some people commented asking if they could use Venmo etc and they were told if they have her personal Venmo to go ahead and use that but they didn’t want to put her Venmo out to the public. That’s what I read on the comments of the post. I’m not donating to it so I don’t have an opinion on it either way."
1960,jmio80g,comment,shannon830,MissingPersons,1685648342,"I don’t. I saw in one of the articles it said he disappeared from his home on Musgrove (sp?) Place in Spring TX. They did not give the actual address but you can get a feel for the area as there are homes with a wooded area out back.

Edit: the forest is looking to be only about a mile or so away so it’s very possible!"
1961,jmhynse,comment,shannon830,ColbyRichards,1685638746,If he’s not working he’s likely not getting paid unless they initiate some type of leave for him (if he has it).
1962,jmhlkf6,comment,shannon830,ColbyRichards,1685633875,"The cousin just posted and said some of his coworkers said he seemed quiet at work in the days leading up to his disappearance. Could that be them just trying to think of any possible thing that could help? Could it be normal tired at work? Could he have been not sleeping well due to anxiety/depression or some other mental health issue that was not known? We can only speculate. On one hand I feel like there is no way he just vanished and they have to find him soon, then I think of all of the other missing person spanning years and just don’t know. I hope they get some answers."
1963,jmhc92p,comment,shannon830,MissingPersons,1685630249,"The state forest is not where they found his cup from my understanding. They found it in the small wooded area just behind their house, a place where he would sometimes go to meditate. I’m sure they are searching the forest but I don’t think they had any solid indications he went there. They don’t have much to go on from the families reports."
1964,jmh2s9i,comment,shannon830,AshaDegree,1685626283,I agree with you
1965,jmh266e,comment,shannon830,MissingPersons,1685626008,Good question. I said similar. Does she know what time he left? They say 5am but if she didn’t hear him get up it could’ve been earlier.
1966,jmgzmu0,comment,shannon830,AshaDegree,1685624850,"I don’t know what you’re saying here, because the people coming from Facebook, as you say, are typically the ones saying the parents are guilty and won’t acknowledge anything else. This sub used to have back and forth discussions. Then suddenly we have people who literally will say that they are not reading your reply because it’s nonsense and the parents are guilty. They just repeat this over and over and give the same reasons without any discussion. If people think the parents are guilty great. I don’t see why they try to shove that down the throats of others. I’ve seen many theories over the years and never have I seen one trying to be pushed on others as I have this. If I had an absolute theory I honestly wouldn’t really be here because I’m my mind there would be no discussion. There are a group of people who ruined this sub. I’ve blocked many of them and many of them have more than one account. I’m an adult and trying to have discussion about a case on reddit. I don’t interact with people acting like pissed off teenagers with their point blank period statements and 50 emojis to try and make a point. Those are the people who need to stick to facebook and YouTube or wherever they came from."
1967,jmgwxr3,comment,shannon830,MissingPersons,1685623570,"I’ve been following this from the beginning on the families Facebook page and here. There is a ton of misinformation reported. They do not live in a heavily wooded area. The woods outback of their house are not woods to get lost in like they reported. Per his wife, she woke and he was not in bed and she assumed he was getting ready for work. When he did not return to the bedroom she went looking around the house and he was gone. She said the front and garage doors were locked. She noticed the back gate open which was off because they always kept it closed with having pets and kids. He was athletic but not a regular morning runner. He left without phone or wallet and on foot. Police found his Yeti cup sitting upright in the wooded area. He sometimes went back in this area to meditate. 

Early articles stated things like it was dense woods and he was a long distance runner. Hoping for his safe return! This is bizarre for sure."
1968,jmfn3ey,comment,shannon830,houston,1685591752,"Possibly! I was thinking it was just to show positives about him, to appeal to the public (to gain more interest in searching for him). But what you say makes sense!"
1969,jmfbgqa,comment,shannon830,houston,1685585915,I searched around the area on google earth and you described it perfectly. I could see how on some main roadways it looked Forrest lives but it was actually just a few trees. I could see the wooded area behind the houses on his street and it wasn’t very big. Hoping they get some answers soon.
1970,jmetds3,comment,shannon830,houston,1685577734,Yeah the name “Woodlands” and the initial post about him walking into the woods outback and not returning really gave the impression this was a heavily wooded area. It wasn’t until I was reading people’s comments that I figured out it’s not! Makes this even stranger!
1971,jmehsui,comment,shannon830,houston,1685572708,I’ll have to check it out on google earth. Sounds interesting!!
1972,jmecf13,comment,shannon830,houston,1685570509,"Thank you for that explanation! That makes sense how you describe it. I’m not from TX so it was hard to grasp the area, as it was referred to as woods then some said just a strip of greenery. Based on what you said, it seems he’s not freely wandering the streets (just my guess). I feel like someone would have spotted him by now. Nearer to where I’m from a person could more or less “disappear” on to some random city streets and no one would know them."
1973,jme6n9w,comment,shannon830,houston,1685568264,I got that feel based on what I’ve heard about the area (not a dense woods) and the search grids they’ve posted seem pretty extensive. We heard he left without a phone or wallet. Possibly he had cash on him? Is public transportation readily accessible there? What type of area is this? Small town type or more city like? I’m not familiar. Would a lot of people recognize him if he were out there wandering confused?
1974,jmdgbd1,comment,shannon830,houston,1685558475,Search now called off by the sheriff’s department. Is that typical? I’m not sure how long they actively search for someone.
1975,jmc3dfh,comment,shannon830,houston,1685539564,The change in career could be the tipping point to a mental break. I keep going back to this. Seems like he took off and not in his right frame of mind.
1976,jm97ba1,comment,shannon830,houston,1685481755,"If he’s having some type of mental health issue or just somehow got dehydrated from being lost, he likely wouldn’t know he even needed to drink, I think is what they are saying."
1977,jm8x7wd,comment,shannon830,ColumbineKillers,1685477773,I like this video. It’s poor quality but a decent montage of clips. These are all videos (most of us) have watched numerous times. I don’t think it’s meant as a tribute more of a “life wasted” feel to me.

1979,jm8swxh,comment,shannon830,houston,1685476097,"Was he spotted on camera acting strangely? I’m just guessing. I thought he could’ve had some sort of mental breakdown so it’s possible. No shame in that, I just hope they can find him to help if that’s the case!"
1980,jm8rsvl,comment,shannon830,houston,1685475666,"The latest post on Facebook: If you see Colby, do not approach him as he may be disoriented. Stay 20-30 feet back. Call 911 and start recording him in case he leaves.

What could this mean? Seems odd to post out of nowhere."
1981,jm8rg9w,comment,shannon830,houston,1685475531,"Agreed. It was hard to see. It made me wonder though, does she know what time he even left? Or did she just wake and he was gone?"
1982,jm8nvtt,comment,shannon830,houston,1685474151,Did you all see the comment on the original Facebook post of the Ring footage of a guy walking at 2:30am? Of course it’s impossible to tell if it’s him but it was a guy of his sort of build in shorts walking. The person said it’s very unusual for anyone to be walking there at that hour.

1985,jm5my98,comment,shannon830,houston,1685416101,"On the Facebook page his wife clarified a few things that seem to be questioned, especially after the latest news articles: (I’m paraphrasing) He was not a long distance runner, he was athletic but didn’t run everyday, the back gate was open which was unusual, the front door and garage were locked, LE found his water bottle in the wooded area behind their home, he went to this area often to meditate/pray but that was not his normal every morning routine, he had work this day (Friday), there were no actual sightings but some possible leads. It seems that he got up for the day around 5-6am, she didn’t hear him getting ready for work then at some point went looking and found the back gate open. I assume since he did go back there on occasion to walk/meditate that she thought maybe he did that until he obviously didn’t return. Hopefully they find him alive. When I first read this I immediately thought a possible mental break (new baby and change of career within the last year). That could happen with no previously known mental health conditions. Sad story."

The tapes are not released so there is no “unreleased portion “, the entirety is unreleased (with minor exception of a small audio clip that was leaked by a family member of one of the victims). The tapes didn’t motivate Eric and Dylan. They made the tapes. It’s recording of them speaking about their plans and showing their weapons. It’s not a tape that someone else made and they watched to be motivated. Maybe I don’t understand what you mean by that. I think the tapes were something they made with intent to send to the media or to have the media play portions once they were gone. I also think it was partly them doing what they enjoyed (they made a lot of videos) and an attempt to be found out, whether consciously or subconsciously. I think they, in some way, wanted to be caught. Especially Eric, but that’s just my opinion. No one knows if there are existing copies. There is speculation there are. I think there is a copy out there for sure. I don’t think they will be released but I would love to see them."

Susan’s case was not taken seriously in the beginning and I fear a lot of evidence was lost/forgotten. I would love for her family to get closure.

That said, would anyone want anything from them? I think Devon may have gotten something of Dylan’s? I can’t remember right now. I’m always thinking about how their friends may have felt.

His page is public so anyone can watch it rather than speculate.
2015,jh5p221,comment,shannon830,AshaDegree,1682092419,"He stated in his live that he was a very heavy sleeper. If the backpack was already packed all she would have to do was grab it and go. Maybe slip on a pair of pants first. I could wake my 9yo up, let him fall back to sleep then go pack five suitcases and leave my house and he wouldn’t wake back up. So its definitely possible he went back to sleep quickly and never heard her."

Or if they did it would be dismissed as Oh they are just barking at so and so… If he had her backpack he could’ve taken it into the shed to go through it or to add/ take out items. In the dark these small items could have fallen out without him noticing. He could’ve been in possession of the other little girls photo as well.

So I’m thinking: He does something to Asha off property. Goes back with the backpack but doesn’t want it in his trailer. He takes it to the shed and double wraps with the trash bags, dropping shed items unknowingly. Drives the bag out of town limits and dumps it."
2028,jelrpnn,comment,shannon830,AshaDegree,1680396205,I never heard of this or Richard either. Waiting for an update.

2030,jej4hy1,comment,shannon830,AshaDegree,1680353269,"Just touching on the clocks. If you had to get your kids up for school the next day you would definitely reset at least one clock. I had an alarm clock that auto reset if it went off, this was in early 2000s, not sure if it was as far back as 2000, but they may have had something like that. As far as OB knowing the time, I’m wondering if he didn’t know the time but heard “2:30” from statements and assumed that to be the time he saw her."
2031,jej2gny,comment,shannon830,AshaDegree,1680352090,Ahh never considered that! Possibly!
2032,jehwhv6,comment,shannon830,AshaDegree,1680320435,"The woods wasn’t really woods. It was a small grouping of trees. The ground on the shed..I really don’t know. From the one picture I saw it appears to be just a dirt floor. The Turners found the items a couple of days later, I believe. After the trucker sightings were reported they asked all local residents to check their property, outbuildings etc. I think this was Tuesday or Wednesday that week. So if there were any footprints they could have been gone. Also, IF this man was responsible, if his shoe prints were there it wouldn’t be unexpected. Like I said, imo if he was responsible I don’t think he took her to the shed. I think he could’ve taken *her backpack* to the shed."
2033,jehv5ks,comment,shannon830,AshaDegree,1680319696,If this happened I don’t think he took her to the shed. I just think he had the backpack. So her scent and footprints wouldn’t be there.
2034,jehu6we,comment,shannon830,AshaDegree,1680319180,"I was thinking IF this person did something to her, they did it off property. They had her backpack, took it into the shed for whatever reason then wrapped it and disposed of it. OR they took her into the shed too but I think the dogs would have barked at that for sure. This person could’ve had the backpack and tossed it in the old shed until they could figure out what to do with it. Idk I’m just saying this off the top of my head as we discuss."
2035,jehoo5o,comment,shannon830,90s,1680316296,I’m old enough to remember raw umber.
2036,jehnazj,comment,shannon830,AshaDegree,1680315610,"Meaning they probably wouldn’t bark at him, if he lived on property and the dogs were used to him."
2037,jehmcc6,comment,shannon830,AshaDegree,1680315133,"Right. But they may not bark at the people who they know should be there. Still wouldn’t explain why she was out of the house per say, but I feel like no one theory explains everything."
2038,jehi5kw,comment,shannon830,AshaDegree,1680313073,"I first believed she was in the shed mostly because it was how I first read this case: she left her house in the middle of the night in a rainstorm, was seen in the highway, ran into the woods, her items found in the shed, backpack found later. Digging more and more into it, mapping it out, looking at the details available, I started to doubt the shed. However… given this new info I read about this unnamed man living on Turner property- IF he was responsible somehow it could explain how the items got there (he had the backpack there going through it, putting items in, whatever, and some of her items got dropped). This may also explain the other girl’s picture?? And the dogs not barking?? Just rolling ideas around."

2041,t3_12csrj3,post,shannon830,flu,1680717983,"My symptoms started in the very early morning hours of Monday, so today is day 3. On Monday I woke with shaking chills, fever and body aches. Also very painful ears. Urgent care didn’t swab for anything, saying it was a sinus and ear infection. I got antibiotics and nasal spray. 

Day 3 and the ears are better. Sinuses still have pressure and temp is now running 99/100, but I’m taking Advil around the clock because of the body aches. I’m reading some say it lasts a week or more. I just want to feel normal again!"
2042,jeeeudl,comment,shannon830,AshaDegree,1680266263,"I thought that too. But remember: she got up Saturday and was at the middle school most of the day playing her basketball game, then watching her brother. Then she went to the cousin sleepover Saturday night and it was noted they were up late. Something she may not be used to. So the headache and nap on Sunday seem reasonable. And also the nap son Sunday could be why she was up late/awake in the middle of the night. That’s just my guess. I have a nine year old and the only time they really get a headache is if they are sick or very overly tired. Could it have been something else? Possibly but less likely I’d say."

2046,jebx6zm,comment,shannon830,UnresolvedMysteries,1680213606,Good summary of the case. This is one of the cases I check on repeatedly to see if there are updates. My theory is that they were lured out of the house by someone impersonating a cop or emergency worker of some sort. It’s just so bizarre!
2047,jebrxdm,comment,shannon830,AshaDegree,1680211508,"He apparently has a YouTube channel with a bunch of creepy and inappropriate videos, one which he repeats the Blanton name. This is what I’ve read here about him, I haven’t seen the actual video myself."
2048,jeafacr,comment,shannon830,AshaDegree,1680192928,I’d like to know more about the Turner trailer guy for sure. That was new news to me. I’d like to add that groomer doesn’t have to mean stranger. Someone close to her/her family or a family member could fall into the groomer category.
2049,je7ndvn,comment,shannon830,AshaDegree,1680135519,Someone commented on a post about him from about a month ago. It appears they have reported him in the past.
2050,je39g5d,comment,shannon830,AshaDegree,1680056275,"If the photo from the shed is tied to the case I definitely think it was grooming in some way. I just am not 100 percent it’s related because there’s never really been any more info on it,"
2051,je37s2f,comment,shannon830,AshaDegree,1680055477,A source saying it ended in the driveway? I’ve heard that a bunch of times but I’ve never seen it in writing. Do you happen to remember where?
2052,je35fdt,comment,shannon830,AshaDegree,1680054379,Good. Same here.
2053,je34sha,comment,shannon830,AshaDegree,1680054093,You just said in previous comments people were messaging you then say I’m one of the “hacks” you’re talking about? I’ve been here commenting from this same account you can go back and look at that yourself. So how am I “one of the hacks”? I don’t need to message anyone I’ll say what I want right here. I also don’t need to hack or act like a bot or whatever you think is going on. I will say what I say all from this account right here. And I never said anything other than responding to posts or comments. Some I don’t agree and people get nasty and guess what I’ll get that way right back. What’s funny is this all started with some newer accounts and me simply responding saying I disagreed with this or that. Then people got rude so here we are.
2054,je32zib,comment,shannon830,AshaDegree,1680053280,Don’t like  conversations? Then you’re in the wrong place. I’ve been here for a long time and will continue to comment. If i disagree I will say it AND say why. Which I’ve done. This person and another couple don’t like anyone replying unless they agree with them. Then they claim harassment?  It’s laughable. Don’t want to see me? Block me. I don’t give AF trust me. None of the people I’m referring to add value to anything here.
2055,je31zsd,comment,shannon830,AshaDegree,1680052837,"Wtf are you talking about? Yes I saw deleted comments and mentions of the uncle, no comments from someone claiming to be the uncle. Hack? I’ve been on this sub for years commenting and posting unlike you. You and a few other accounts can’t handle being proven wrong or different opinions other than the family is responsible. People have literally made new accounts to come and argue points. This never occurred before I saw certain names in this sub. So you can think whatever TF you want. Don’t like what I post or comment? Block me like the other troll who cant handle feedback and calls it harassment and bullying! I’ve NEVER messaged you or anyone so take your bullshit to someone else. You claim people are messaging you?? Well guess what I have way better things to do with my time. Find someone else to be paranoid about. You got the wrong one with me."

2064,je1s3po,comment,shannon830,AshaDegree,1680033729,Oh wow really? I’ve never had any encounters like that. I don’t want to suggest someone is lying but I find it hard to believe an investigator is chiming in. I wish they would though! I saw mention about some “family” on here but then saw a lot of deleted accounts so I think trolls.
2065,je1r1m2,comment,shannon830,AshaDegree,1680033349,"Someone earlier told me they were an investigator on the case in 2018 and 2020, I asked an additional question but didn’t get a response yet."

It came with a little brush to apply. For some reason I think it also may of had some sort of a setting powder with it that you applied over the lip color. I’ve searched everything I can think of about it and can’t find on google. Does anyone else remember this?
This would be in the US and was bought in a drugstore. Not very expensive."

2177,jm7fyq1,comment,graynorv,LSD,1685457233,"FULL TRIP REPORT:

4:00
met “ole Johnny” while smoking at the park in downtown Asheville. I smoked him out and we talked for a little while and he offers me some paper tabs, I say hell yeah because I’ve always wanted to try LSD and I was in a good head space. 

4:30
I took 3 tabs of what he gave me and it was bitter as fuck and tasted metallic. I went into urban outfitters across from the park and was looking around and started feeling a bit anxious. I did some research and everywhere I looked said LSD should not taste like anything, so now I’m concerned. I go back to the park and ask Johnny if what he gave me was acid and he said “it’s better”. 

5:00 
At this point I’m like fuck it I have to just hang in there. I walk away from the park because there’s more homeless people around then before and I don’t really wanna be around a lot of people. I start feeling a nervousness in my stomach and I can tell some shits about to happen.

5:30 - 6:00 
I start to feel like my whole body weighs thousands of pounds and I’m being pulled to the ground. Colors are a lot brighter and I’m things are starting to look super HD. I had this sensation twice that I pissed myself but when I checked I didn’t, that was weird. 

6:00-7:00 
my body starts feeling a little less weighted but I feel happy as hell. Every time I pass someone on the sidewalk I ask how they’re doing and just feel amazing. When I look at someone’s face I would lose depth perception and it felt like their face was literally touching mine, it was weird. Everything was super HD almost like shit looked fake and if I looked at something far away it was like I was looking down a tunnel. I walked past this guy with a dog and asked if I could pet him and he said “of course”, the dogs hair moved in waves and I felt like every hair on his body was meant to be there. And was just amazed as how this creature was right in front of me. I went near this restaurant that I can’t remember the name of and food looked so foreign to me. It didn’t look appealing at all. So much so that it actually made me a little queasy watching people shove burgers into their mouth. 

7:00-9:00
 I go sit in the park and try to find Johnny but he’s gone. At this point I didn’t know his name so I asked this guy if he knew him and that’s when he said “yeah man that’s ole Johnny, he’s been living on the streets of Asheville for over 30 years”. I couldn’t believe it, homeless for 30 years. It actually sounded exciting in my state, free as a song bird (Even though in reality that would be terrible). I talked to this guy and these 2 older women about life and how they all ended up in Asheville. And I eventually told them I was on some shit that Johnny gave me. And they were like “ah hell, Johnny be having some good shit”. I almost asked them what he could have gave me but in my mind I felt like they would have thought I was paranoid and I didn’t want that. Besides I was having a great time. This guy walked by with a sparkler (I guess because Memorial Day) and it was the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen. I would get insane tracers when he moved it. 

9:00 - 11:00 
I get in my car and put in some music and nothing really sounds good, not even Pink Floyd, Tipper, the dead, nothing. I think because I knew the music was prerecorded and was playing through speakers. I thought to myself there’s no love in this music, it’s all playing through man made speakers and it’s prerecorded. So I turned off the music and laid my seat down and rolled down my windows and just listed to cars go by and people walking around. I noticed when I would close my eyes I could see these geometric patterns and it was beautiful. It was like perfect shapes put together flowing in my eyes. After about an hour of that I had to pee so I left and found a restroom and it was so gross, I felt like wow we literally have placed for humans to use the bathroom. It didn’t feel natural. The lines between the tiles  in the bathroom floor started flowing like waves so that was interesting. 

11:00-5:00
I decide I’m able to drive home so I drive home and I think to myself there’s no way in hell I can sleep. My mind is going like 100mph even though my body is exhausted. I make it home and drink some apple juice and it tastes amazing. I end up calling a friend and talking to him about my experience and stay up the remainder of the night watching tv and playing video games. At around 5am I’m able to sleep for a couple hours and I wake up this morning feeling drained."

2179,jm5ny16,comment,graynorv,LSD,1685416598,Weirdly enough when I close my eyes now I see all kinds of patterns like going through my eyes.

I had a few times where I felt like I pissed myself but I didn’t lol weird. I never saw the guy again that gave me the tabs but I asked someone else at the park and they said his name his ole Johnny and he’s been living on the street of Asheville for over 30 years. Interesting guy but wish he would have game me real lsd. Who knows what this is all he said was it’s “better”. I wish I could get info on what it was I took. About an hour and a half in I got pretty intense and my body felt like it was being pulled down to the ground but after about 30 min that let up. I feel like I’m over the peak now but I’m still tripping pretty hard."

Hey guys, I’m new to this community. I’m going to start off my saying, yes I’m a hypochondriac. I’ve thought I’ve had about every illness there is. With that being said, I’m worried I might be starting to get TN. 

Ever since I was kid, I would get neuralgia in both my ears maybe once or twice every few years. But it was very mild and would always go away the next day. About 2 years ago I had pain in my left ear that was so bad it made me cry and I couldn’t eat. Electric shocks that would take my breath away when they hit. I went to an ear doctor everything looked okay and that was that. Pain went away for years. About 6 months ago, I got this pressure in my ear and I thought that the pain was gonna come but it never did. This pressure lasted months and one day I did get some electric shocks in my ear but it was pretty mild and ibuprofen stopped it. I went to my ear doctor again and he said it might be TN and gave me Tegretol. I never had to take it because it never got bad.  Then one day I remember getting shocks in the back of my head where my neck meets my head. That’s the only time I’ve ever gotten that. When I was at work about 2 months ago I got some shocks in my head on left size and above ear, it made we wince. I took the Tegretol and pain went away and everything was good. Recently I just moved and have been very stressed and I’ve been getting horrible headaches every day. I got a shock one time about 3 days ago in the shower on the left size of my head above my ear. But just one. I’ve been feeling a sorta achy feeling on my left temple and around my jaw but sometimes my right side aches too. I was at the store today and got a mild shock on my left jaw and now I’m terrified that this is the beginning of the end. Is this what the start of TN looks like? Am I doomed to live a life of pain and agony? Is it only going to get worse? All these posts on here scare me and I’m wondering if the majority of people that have TN have it under control or is it truly just better off to be dead. I’m freaking out and need advice. Is it possible that this might not even be TN? I’m going to see a nuero soon to see what he thinks but not until the pain gets really bad and constant."

I have fullness in my ear that started a couple days ago and it feels sorta achy. I keep holding my nose and blowing to relieve pressure but it doesn’t really help.

I’ve had it in both ears all through out my life but it’ll be random. Maybe like 3 shocks of pain over a year. So I never thought anything of it. 2 days ago I got a couple sharp pains in my left ear and a sense of fullness and a really and headache.  (I didn’t sleep good the night before). I haven’t had a sharp pain since but my ear still feels full. Could it be that the nerve in my ear is only triggered when the blood vessel near it is inflamed or something? Like because I didn’t sleep good the night before and had a migraine? I’ve only had a truly horrible episode once in my life which was about a year ago, it was so bad I couldn’t even eat.

Im getting anxiety dizziness, extra saliva, pit in my stomach feeling, its about 45 min after it happened. Has anyone had this before? Was it just floaters? They didnt seem like it but idk. Presyncope epsiode? Idk what else to call it. Ive faitned before back in 2013 and didnt have this. But now im afraid of passing out (biggest fear).

Ive also had like 5.5 hrs of sleep and a sinus headache for the morning. Went away around 11."

2377,k42vsl6,comment,LemonBerry365,POTS,1696819147, The CHOP one I found online when I saw it mentioned. Ahh the not sharing might be why I cant find that one online. My dysautonomia specialist told me to do exercises and start small and work my waY up. I prefer to workout at home. Does physical therapy help?

The doc yesterday said the POTs causes my dizziness. I was having a hard time accepting it and think there is more to it that they are missing. Also my anxiety is from the symptoms, so when i get super dizzy I get super anxious. Or Panicky. Its a cycle for me."

 This doctor is a dysautonomia specialist. He is certain after my TTT its Pots, he said he is trying to see if their is an underlying cause for it. I also don't handle heat very well at all, so this is not going to go well at all."
2397,k3n8q2w,comment,LemonBerry365,POTS,1696547480,Mine varies as well.
2398,k3n8anl,comment,LemonBerry365,seizures,1696547296,"I have almost the same symptoms. And they come so randomly or stop randomly, skipped a year, it came back. MRI, ct scan, Eeg both normal. My symptoms started as a in 2021
- weird wave like of dizziness
- tingling starting at feet going up my body
-Heart racing
-Shaking legs
-Anxiety 
-Flushed
-Sweaty palms
-Feel like im gonna faint(the tingling and dizziness) give me this feeling. As ive fainted before in 2013

Mine last under a min, probably under 30 seconds except my heart and legs take a little bit to calm down. Then after im able.to just continue on with my day except being scared it will happen. Im completely aware of my surrondings and everything. 


Now in 2023
-That weird feeling in head 
-Pit in stomach
-Tingling in face/mouth
-Weird taste almost sweet some docs think !adrenaline 
-Legs shaking 
-Heart racing
-Sweaty palms 
-Anxiety feeling

And the same as before they happen quickly, and randomly. Like 1or 2 a month for a couple of months"

2401,k3kqxyz,comment,LemonBerry365,POTS,1696514584,Oh no im sorry.  I have an appointment with my dysautonomia specialist today and will ask about PT. Im glad its working for you.
2402,k3kmjk7,comment,LemonBerry365,POTS,1696512763,Thank you. I will definitely look into it! Earlier this year I was doing weights at home with 10-20lbs depending on the exercise and I had a set back.  Now just neevous.
2403,k3ipzgn,comment,LemonBerry365,POTS,1696471346,Thank you. I can do a few squats/calf raises now. Im just so scared of getting that dizzt/faint feeling again. Maybe i need to just start on the floor to get over the anxiety of it all.

2405,k3gji37,comment,LemonBerry365,dysautonomia,1696441973,I have read that deconditioning can cause symptoms to flare up a lot. I can tell that last year I was exercising and out of bed a lot and doing so much and felt so good! But this year after being sick with a virus along with my kids being sick and being in bed i slid backwards it feels like.

Anyway I feel like I have more going on. The TTT brought up my hr, i also started panicking for some reasons, calves were tight, dizzy and flushed. The dizziness is an everyday complaint almost.  But I have other symptoms that the test didnt bring out, well epsiodes. I hope you get your answers soon or figure it out. The unknown adds a lot of anxiety for me. 

No other symptoms for me that you posted."
2409,k3ccw0y,comment,LemonBerry365,POTS,1696368866,I cant take Xanax bc it made my anxiety worse and symptoms worse. I took a small dose of another benzo for a dental appointment that they prescribed me and it didn't mess with me at all. I could actually see a decrease in my dizziness too. Id definitely talk to your doc though about your concerns. They would be best to guide ya through it as everyone is different
2410,k3ccek6,comment,LemonBerry365,POTS,1696368692,I am worried about this. Im not on meds at the moment but my resting hr is 50-60 even sitting up earlier I was at 58. So not sure if I want to even chance meds. Its a good conversation to have with your doctor.
2411,k3cbj72,comment,LemonBerry365,POTS,1696368385,Oh no. I hope it doesn't happen.
2412,k3cbgnp,comment,LemonBerry365,POTS,1696368360,Oh my. I dont know how I missed your reply.  But I cant imagine. Does anything help?
2413,k3bb23g,comment,LemonBerry365,dysautonomia,1696355816,Ive tried buspirone.  It helped at first. They tried small dose Xanax but it made me worse... docs reallt dont know what it is bc it came out of no where and didn't have any anxiety prior to this happening.
2414,k3apxtc,comment,LemonBerry365,dysautonomia,1696348196,"Yes my anxiety only pops up with the symptoms so like if I get dizzy then ill get anxious.. never really have the racing thoughts until then. I too had a bone marrow biopsy and was cool as a cucumber but my TTT threw me into crying and panicking during the standing part..  my therapist even thinks that my anxiety if it wasn't for the symptoms and unknown of whats going on would be gone or significantly lessened when the dizziness pops up. I had these weird out of no where epsiodes/attacks that started all of this back in 2021 and I had to learn that not every feeling I feel would send me into 1 of those. The doctors and ive seen plenty since then still have no clue what they are. 


In 2021 I had :
Tingling in feet working up body 
Got super hot
A quick wave like feeling(dizziness maybe)
Felt like I was going to faint
Racing heart
Legs shaking
Palm's sweaty 
Flushed afterwards 

They only lasted under a min, except the hr N legs shaking took a bit to calm down. It happened out of no where and from end of feb 2021-may of 2021. 

After that the dizziness stayed (Pppd im told)and all these weird symptoms. I couldnt go into stores, reasturants, walk a lot, i had anxiety being alone, it was horrible. 


Then in 2022 i was fine-ish i was able to exercise, go into stores for about 15-20 min before id get to hot and dizzy, i ate in a few reasturants, walked the beach, went to an arcade for an hour, get togethers ect..  even moved across country. 

2023 end of March BAM they started again but thus time it was:
Tingling in mouth
Weird tatse kinda sweet(maybe adrenaline)?
Pit in stomach 
Faint feeling
The wave like feeling in head
Heart racing 
Legs shaking
Palms sweaty


Ive been told SVT(ruled out), anxiety, im a mystery, shuffled around from specialist to specialist. Had an EEG for focal seizures, MRI(clear), 2 Ct scans head(clear), EP study,  i have an internal loop recorder, lots of blood work, therapy.. My hematologist scanned my chest, abdomen and pelvis just to check as well. 

Now i see a dysautonomia specialist and he said he thinks POts. Had the poor mans Tilt in his office which my hr went up and sustained, so he pretty much said POTs, had the TTT and my hr definitely went up and stayed up however I started to panic at 6 min in.. idk why.. i cried and begged them to take me down. I didn't feel like fainting or anything. But it also dosnt recreated those episodes i get either. 


Sorry this was so long."

I had to stop since the end of March when I after a year of exercising decided to try a quick HITT work out got faint 15 min after I was done.

I go tomorrow for my official diagnosis although the doc is certain I have it. He even wrote it on my diagnosis already for my insurance... my hr 100% jumps and stays high usually 113-130... highest recorded was 177.."

He also ordered a bunch of blood work and a sweat test to see what kind of POTs I have did anyone have this done? I looked up the sweat test and it has me worried as 1. I cant stand being in a hot or humid environment and 2. I read stuff about pure autonomic failure and other stuff and that scares me."
2426,k378ie8,comment,LemonBerry365,dysautonomia,1696283491,Thank you. My guess was both but idk. I have so many docs with so many ideas bascially. My new Pcp was the first to say I think there is a lot more going on then anxiety.  My neuro thought dysautonomia and or focal seizures but nothing showed up on EEG so sent me to another specialist (dysautonomia) i am so tired of being passed around bascially.

2428,k32xkg2,comment,LemonBerry365,POTS,1696209413,Yeah. Its a big fear of mine. The doctors haven't called back. So gotta wait til tomorrow. I really don't want to go through the embarrassment of going to the doctors to get impacted stool taken care of :-(

Could be an ear infection.  Mine were clogges due to an awful sinus infection. It was so bad, so I was using saline mist then the doc told me to try a saline rinse, and I tried flonase before that and warm compresses when they were sore and my cheeks hurt from the sinus infection. I hope you feel better soon!!"

2431,k32eg5u,comment,LemonBerry365,Dizziness,1696201299,Not usually. I did a few times but that was only when I had a lack of sleep for like a week when I was sick.
2432,k315jnh,comment,LemonBerry365,Dizziness,1696184796,"Yes my anxiety came afterwards and I was normal the next day as well. My pppd never came with vision issues. Mine makes me feel like im on a boat when lying down or sitting and then standing felt like im swaying or being pulled side to side almost like watching a drunk person walk. Its just crazy and has prevented me from so much.  Thats crazy you had them off a year as well. I wonder what they could be. Ive had a clear MRI, ct scan of head, neck ct showed something like normal wear and tear or something but neuro and ortho doc both said wouldnt be causing me to be dizzy like i am. I was checked for seizures even but my eeg was normal. But i was told they only detect if your having seizure activity at that time."

I had it end of feb to mid April and about 4 of them. 

I had 0 of these in 2022, then in 2023 they started again. Only this time i got tingling in the mouth and a weird taste and pit in stomach feeling. Docs cant figure it out."

Now since march/ april not so much. Its peaked my anxiety too. Which my pcp and Therapist agree the anxiety is coming from the symptoms bc im fine until they hit :-( I had vestibular therapy. It lasted 6 weeks and since I was getting somewhat better they graduated me and said come back if things get bad again and we eneded up moving last year. Maybe I need to find a new one.  Im on week 3 of battling some virus on top of a sinus infection so could be why I am feeling off the last couple of days. On top of lack of.a full nights sleep.  I am glad your 95% better and I hope you can kick the last 5%."

I was on antibiotics, saline spray instead of netipot, although the doc gave me asample of a saline rinse, flonase and decongestant. Mine are just starting to clear up after 2 weeks. They are still messed up but definitely getting a lot better. I can finally hear better and doesn't feel completely clogged."
2462,k25wvu6,comment,LemonBerry365,Dizziness,1695663076,"Yeah thats how mine is, its not a lot though, today ive had this off balance feeling walking like being pulled side 2 side. Rocking on a boat feeling when laying down. And slight nausea and dizzy when i mive my head 2 fast(not normal for my dizziness) but I am slowly recovering from a bad sinus infection and retracted eardrums. That might be contributing."

I was diagnosed with anxiety 7m after I had these weird episodes.. and 5m after the dizziness/offf balance started. And then the falling feeling started after that. Its all weird. My therapist thinks my anxiety was bc of whatever those ""episodes"" i had were and that now when I get dizzy or any feeling that resembles those, then the anxiety comes out."

Im so sorry you are dealing with that. How long have you been dizzy?"
2475,t3_16ramzx,post,LemonBerry365,Dizziness,1695593977,Has anyone had a falling sensation when they aren't. Like laying in bed just now relaxing and felt like I was gonna fall. Or sitting on a chair and feeling like it was gonna come out from under you or your gonna fall off.
2476,k20xfvs,comment,LemonBerry365,Anxiety,1695579562,Yes and now. Depends on how sick I am. Right now yes.
2477,k20xaaz,comment,LemonBerry365,Dizziness,1695579508,"They don't think the dizziness is from the POTs. I was told the opposite that PoTs commonly gets misdiagnosed as anxiety. Which I do have as well. But to be completely honest with you. Im not 100% on board with the POTS diagnosis. Like i dont get exhausted doing things, however I do get dizzy. Last year and up until March I was exercising 45 min-1 hr a day.   They think based on the tilt table(which made me panic) and the fact that before that, during the testing my hr jumped 30-45 bpm standing and stayed high.. 

Like I said the dysautonomia specialist is the one who diagnosed it(so far). 

Honestly the dizizness I was diagnosed with PPPD and the neuro/specialist isnt on board with it but symptoms fit.mostly. im just so lost after 2.5 years."
2478,k20vfgo,comment,LemonBerry365,Dizziness,1695578885,A dysautonomia specialist ive been seeing. He actually wrote it as a diagnosis based on symptoms and the testing be preformed. I had the tilt test as well. I have my follow up in a couple weeks with him. As he was waiting on blood work results to have everything.
2479,k20uds1,comment,LemonBerry365,Dizziness,1695578528,"Awesome thank you so much! My vestibular therapist back in 2021 gave me an exercise where you stand and look at an x on a post it note. Nose level and shake her head left and right and up and down. I have to see if I still have my.paper work for that. I will also try these other exercises. I have an awful sinus infection right now with my ear drum retracted so im sure its making the symptoms 100% worse:-( 

Have you ever felt like wheb you were sitting you were going to fall off the chair? Or like it was coming out from under you? 

Thank you so much for typing them out for me. Definitely going to give them a try."
2480,k20svfc,comment,LemonBerry365,Dizziness,1695578011,"Back in 2021 i was diagnosed with PPPD, it took a long time to fight back for me. As I was goijg through other stuff. 2022 was great, it was still there but I was able to go to the parks and play for a while with my kids, practice sports with them, stand in small lines, heck just even go into a store, exercise, i even moved.. now im back at sqaure 1 it feels like and my drive to fight back is low right now(probably bc ive been sick for 2 weeks) l am so happy for you that you are doing better. Posts like these give me inspiration."
2481,k20s647,comment,LemonBerry365,Dizziness,1695577781,Thank you! Do you get it even laying down? Like the sense you are rocking on a boat/just moving when ur not? Also stores are horrific for me.
2482,k1zpnyq,comment,LemonBerry365,Dizziness,1695563469,I hope so. It's been off and on for 2 years since I was diagnosed. But over 2 years since it started.
2483,k1y18a6,comment,LemonBerry365,Dizziness,1695525368,Yes I had those therapies back in 2021. I should really do them again and see if they help.
2484,k1xld3e,comment,LemonBerry365,Dizziness,1695517989,I cant stand side effects. Thank you for all the help.
2485,k1xkmhu,comment,LemonBerry365,Dizziness,1695517659,Oh wow thank you. Yup Ive never had spinning vertigo. But my rocking can last days sometimes. I cant deal with stores. They make me feel like symptoms and then I start to panic.  So i do have anxiety but it stems from all those symptoms and so many docs not knowing whats going on. 1 doc thinks my episodes arw PoTS. SO they basically are adding a diagnosis and still leaving me with questions.
2486,k1xjx4p,comment,LemonBerry365,Dizziness,1695517347,Thank you. I will look into that!!
2487,k1xjbak,comment,LemonBerry365,Dizziness,1695517079,Oh and its not 24/7
2488,k1xj5rj,comment,LemonBerry365,Dizziness,1695517013,"Oh I know. Ive seen a therapist and my PCP say I developed anxiety bc of all of this.. 

No cruise or airplane ride. I did have a few incidents happen before this started. Which is why some docs blamed anxiety. Those symptoms were. 

Hot and tingling started in legs working way up my body
Heart racing
Legs shaking
I felt like I was going to faint
Palms sweaty 
Then flushed afterwards

These epsiodes happened randomly and out of nowhere. Started feb of 2021. Then started by april of 2021. March is when the dizziness/off balance feeling started. Then in 2022 I had 0 epsiodes. But the off balance was definitely still there. 

In 2023 they epsiodes started again randomly 1 day. Only this time it was a
quick weird wave like feeling in head
Tingling in face and  mouth 
Weird taste
Pit in stomach 
Shaking
Heart racing

Now both in 2021 and 2023 they would only last like 30-45 seconds.  

No covid that I know of. My fam didnt get it til 2022. Not infection beforehand either."
2489,k1xhtsq,comment,LemonBerry365,Dizziness,1695516435,"I will have to look into what those are. Like for me, being in car 95% of the time doesn't make my symptoms worse. Before this all started I preferred moving. Now idk.. its like I can do things some days and its no bother and other days I feel like im being pulled to 1 side (like cooking). I also will be sitting in a chair or somethint and feel like the chair is gonna come out from under me or im gonna fall off which isnt the case, some of my doctors say its anxiety 🤔 some say they aren't sure. When it comes to that part."
2490,k1xhdvb,comment,LemonBerry365,Dizziness,1695516241,I just started watching The Steady coach. Breathing techniques ive tried but the dont work. Keeping my mind off of it does sometimes. Cooking with it not so much. Other stuff just depends. I hope you find some relief soon.

2492,k1xe7qt,comment,LemonBerry365,Dizziness,1695514866,Thanks. Yeah mine is a lot less laying down than standing but definitely there laying down. And ues standing I have swaying feeling like being pulled to the side when im not or being pushed fwd but its mostly the side.

2494,k1mh9n2,comment,LemonBerry365,etd,1695331821,Its crazy how long this can last.  I hope your ears go back to normal before the ENT! I can imagine hearing that. My antibiotics are for a week so if it doesn't subside by then I will be calling an ENT.
2495,k1mgtde,comment,LemonBerry365,etd,1695331663,Oh wow. Im glad it was quick. Thank you. I hope your  eustachian tube behaves itself once the tubes fall out.
2496,k1mcg8m,comment,LemonBerry365,etd,1695330096,Oh wow. Thank you for that heads up. Did the tube hurt? Did it help? Sorry for the questions just want to prepare myself in case it comes down to it.
2497,k1mbrub,comment,LemonBerry365,etd,1695329859,Im hoping it will do. That really stinks they marked it as non urgent. I had slight tinnitus lasted a few seconds and went away so idk if id even call it that.
2498,k1mbfeo,comment,LemonBerry365,etd,1695329740,Oh no. Did you see an ENT or anything? The doctor said she hoped the antibiotics will help with the sinuses and then my eardrum might have less pressure. Also the nasal steroids. But idk..
2499,k1m912s,comment,LemonBerry365,etd,1695328919,Oh no im sorry to hear that. If I dont get better in a week or so I was.told to call the ENT.

I do and if it happens a lot my anxiety starts to creep in."

Massaging sinuses and ear
Warm compresses 
Saline spray
Flonase
The ear drops
Steam
Yawning 
Chewing gum 
Squeezing my nose and blowing 
Squeezing nose and swallowing 


Nothing worked. So that is a miracle. Looks like ill be going to the store after the nausea from zpack goes away."
2506,k1gqmcm,comment,LemonBerry365,EustachianTubeClick,1695240041,Thank you. Im glad you found relief! I read about antihistamines online today. The urgent care docs were pushing decongestants. I think my body needs a break from them. I will definitely try maybe Claritin. I have some in the house already. It's so annoying as everything is muffled!!
2507,k1cgfrf,comment,LemonBerry365,EustachianTubeClick,1695166988,Urgent care checked it 2 days ago. They said it was a little bit red but thinks its from all the congestion and stuff and not an ear infection.  Didn'tsay anything about wax. But im getting a second opinion from my pcp Thursday.  I hope yours improves soon.

She had gunk in her eyes 1 day along with burning.   Then 7 days later I started with the sore throat, and  day 2 the cough started. Day 1 was miserable..  chills, body aches, low fevers, raging sore thraot. Now on day 4 i have an awful sore thraot still, swollen tonsils, sinus pain/pressure, stuffy nose off and on.

2675,t3_162534y,post,LeonKennedy86,WaltDisneyWorld,1693080152,"Got back from a 7 night. It was 14 months since our last WDW vacation - longest gap for us ever. We usually go 1-2 times a year. Last trip (June 2022) was our worst vacation we’ve ever had, many in our group got COVID. Much of our expected annual pass use went to complete waste. Had to run around booking extra rooms to try to avoid getting COVID (my wife caught it, I did not, nor did my daughter). 

Between the amount of money we dropped and the limited magic we were able to have with so many (11 of 16 by the end) of our party getting sick I really began to question how much we would be returning. With ME gone and the G+ changes we had already been souring.

I am happy to report that this vacation was incredible! We were “plused” multiple times on this trip by cast members. The overall experience at both resorts was wonderful (Beach Club and BLT) and we all had an absolute blast. Weather was extreme, but we had a lot of pool time and got that 99 dollar a day deal at the four parks.

I have to be honest, since COVID and the changes since then I was seriously considering selling DVC. The magic, for me at least, was waning. This last trip really revived my love for all things WDW.

Bay Lake Tower is a seriously underrated spot. Highly recommend!"

The middle can get you back to an important side quicker to stop a push and get way more damage than a bow on all game flank shooter.  And yes nobody pushes through so it doesnt really matter.

2793,j90lvkf,comment,scrawfrd02,WorldOfWarships,1676710232,"Additionally, If you lemming, you are losing damage because others will hog it.  If you are the one who takes the initiative and separates yourself you will have the broadsides because they will be angling to the most fire.  The 1 or 2 guys who kite and keep away the enemy team alone on their own side are the heros that salvage the wins.  If you have 3 battleships on 1 side and you own the cap, what else is there to accomplish at that cap.  You have to look at the minimap and realize when its time to move to the other side, you will win so much more.  Anticipate the minimap and look at it more than you look at your screen.  Some of you may not get this now, but when you get good you will look back and remember how bad you played.  Trust, and watch good things start to happen.  Remember someone trying to push you has a disadvantage so push up then pull back and use islands to make your turn back."

Wife was hating her from day 1 saying how much of an unfun biatch she is, and didnt even like cole.  Now her instagram is all up like shes and ig model and thinks shes a hod strong independent woman.  Eyes rolled into the back of my head.  Sickening other women try to empower these people with support instead of calling them out for what they are.  Thats the male bias that exist.  Nothing more hated than a white male these days."

Sometimes a knotted muscle in a different spot can pull on other spots."

When you are the expected sex to make the first move, you try to gauge who you like physically, get up the courage to give it your best shot, then usually get absolutely buried.  You have no idea who wants you to come say hello and be asked out, and who wants you to never even look at them.  Because women will do a smile to hide their feelings, instead of being blunt with  their true feelings.  Some men are good at picking up the little cues, but many are not."

If I eat gluten I'll feel sick for a few days and have GI issues and stomach pain (I had gluten intolerance before covid but it's gotten probably 4-5 times worse). If I overexert myself like staying up too late, too much stress, exercising intensely, I'll feel sick for like 4-5 days with off and on nausea, light headedness, fatigue, and just a general feeling of being unwell.

2975,k022zq4,comment,Daggerdogx,Advice,1694398875,"This is completely normal. There are many reasons you may feel more comfortable having physical touch with female friends. For starters, it goes against social norms to show physical affection with your male friends. Not that there's actually anything wrong wit it, just that it is not the social norm. Women also (in my experience) tend to be more emotionally receptive than men. Not saying that all men aren't emotionally mature, but there's a real stigma among men that talking about feelings and emotions shouldn't happen, especially with other men. Physical touch may just also be your love language and how you express your love with others. Some people love hugs and physical bonding, some people love giving/receiving thoughtful gifts, some people will do chores and tasks for other people. Everyone has different love languages, and you shouldn't feel guilty about yours. Obviously you care about your female friends, and that's perfectly okay. Just also recognize that not everyone will be interested, because maybe they have a different love language, or reserve physical affection for relationships. As long as you communicate respectfully with your female friends and make sure they're okay with it, there isn't anything to feel bad about."
2976,k0221wk,comment,Daggerdogx,Anxiety,1694398455,"Sounds like you're using it just as it is intended then. If you're finding yourself more anxious than usual after taking lorazepam, remember that rebound anxiety is temporary and normal. It will pass"
2977,k0215n0,comment,Daggerdogx,Anxiety,1694398057,"I've taken lorazepam and can give you some information based off what I've read and also my own personal experiences. I use lorazepam for very severe anxiety, when it reaches it's peak. For when I can't get out of fight or flight mode, or if I'm EXTREMELY upset and anxious. Think major panic attack. For this purpose, it is very very effective. However, it does have it's downsides. Lorazepam can cause something caused rebound anxiety. If you take lorazepam today, tomorrow you may feel more anxious. I'm not sure the molecular or chemical reasoning behind this, but it happens. This may be what you are experiencing. I've had rebound anxiety last for a day or two max. Obviously, if you're taking it often and then stop cold turkey this can be exacerbated or even turn into addiction which will be much harder on your mental health. Generally medications like lorazepam you don't want to be taking more than once a week or so. If you're taking it more often than this, you could be having withdrawals, but more likely it sounds like you're just experiencing rebound anxiety. If you find that your anxiety is horrible every day and so you feel you need to take lorazepam everyday, I would talk to your psychiatrist about adding a daily anxiety medication to your routine. This help with everyday anxiety, and you can still use lorazepam as needed for severe anxiety."

I call the customer, and they say they meant to order it for tomorrow and wanted a refund. I guess she got the refund from corporate even though it was 100% her fault and she shouldn't have gotten one. The next day, same order but at 5pm. Got to the highschool. Spent probably 40 minutes delivering the pizzas because I had to take several trips, find where to put them, deal with the PTA parents being extremely unhelpful. Finally finished. Come to find out that they locked the gate behind me. Had to find someone to unlock it for me. Oh. And this time she didn't tip, probably because she blamed us for making the order the night before, even though they ask you multiple times when you want the delivery and you have to confirm.

Took my car there bc the Ford dealership is a joke and couldn't even look at within a week even though they said they were going to like 5+ seperate times. Originally sterling said they were booked out for a couple weeks but after I told them my car was completely broken down and undrivable, they moved things around and took a look at it within 3 days. They found the issue, advised us to take it back to Ford with the new info they gave us, and that we should get it repaired at Ford because it's under warranty still. Didn't charge us a dime even though I'm sure they spent hours doing tests and diagnosing the issue."

The grief just comes in waves. I was there with her as she passed, we sat around her as a family in our home and pet her while she got a feel-good cocktail of medication, followed by the overdose of anesthetic, so she passed very peacefully. Her last few days she didn't want to eat, until I came back home (I live a 2 hour drive away for college) and then I gave her cheese sticks and she was so heartbreakingly happy that I was home. She slept in bed with me every night for years, and had such a good life. She was a rescue, found on the streets as a puppy and we took her in. She was always a very happy dog except for the last week or so when she was just really not feeling well. I'm really struggling, and this is probably the hardest loss I've had to go through so far. I keep getting this lump in my throat, like I'm about to cry. Even when I'm not thinking about it, I'll just feel the lump in my throat. I also get a tightness in my chest that feels like part of me is gone. Like a piece of my heart was just taken with her passing. Also, I really want more of her belongings but my mom wants to keep a lot of them. I know she was important to her too, I just really want some of her belongings too. She was my best friend and I'm not trying to be an asshole or selfish by saying this, but the whole family said I was her favorite. She would listen to my commands more than anyone else in the family, she would follow me around all the time, and want to be in the same room as me all the time. I've honestly considered taking her collar with me next time I stop by once things have calmed down, but I'd also feel pretty bad just taking it like that. I asked for some of her ashes because I want to get a tattoo with them in the ink, and my mom said she only told them to put a tiny bit of them aside for me. I know my mom recognized the special bond we had, because she asked if I wanted a moment alone with her after she passed, but I felt like that would have been selfish with everyone else grieving around me who also needed the closure. I feel like maybe she's just acting in grief and wants to keep her belongings because she's upset, which is understandable, but I just want my piece of her as well. I'm mostly just venting here but would also appreciate any advice anyone has, for getting her collar or helping with the near-constant lump in my throat that doesn't seem to go away. Or any other advice y'all could offer would be great. Thanks in advance."
3047,t3_10z5bsg,post,Daggerdogx,Bellingham,1676069367,"Hey so I was wondering if anyone else has had lots of issues with the service department at the local Ford dealership? My car broke down (undrivable, car won't accelerate) over the weekend and I towed it to the after hours service lot. It was found on Monday with both front doors wide open and unlocked (nothing was stolen luckily). I asked for surveillance footage and they said they'd email it to me. I've reminded them twice. Nothing. They've kept saying they'll give me an update about my car issues at a certain date, then no update. This has happened probably 5-10 times now. They said it'll be looked at by a certain date. Then it's not. Over and over and over again. When I try calling, I'm either put on hold for like 10-15 minutes, or they don't pick up. They haven't given me a price estimate, told me any tests they were thinking of running, or anything else. They've basically just been holding my car and telling me it'll get looked at and that they'll call me with an update and then they don't. This is my only form of transportation so I'm getting very frustrated. They've also asked me what happened 6-7 times, and always say they're writing it down, yet kept asking every phone call for like 4 days. I'm considering just asking for my car back and taking it somewhere else. Any suggestions for other places that provide reasonable service? I don't expect my car fixed within a day, I just want communication where they aren't ignoring you every time you to try to contact them.

Edit: Jason Turrell, the new service manager has reached out and is working on improving the situation. Seems as though maybe there has been some turnover or other staffing issues causing a lot of the issues. Shout out to Jason for being really kind and doing his best to help. Hoping the service department will improve with his leadership"

They've priced gouged like crazy. That being said, the apartments are kind of nice. Only kind of because your individual room has NO storage space whatsoever. Literally an indent into the wall that's like 6 inches deep with a clothing dresser already there. Barely any storage in the apartment area too. So if you have lots of items, probably not a good idea moving there. Overall it's a decent place if you don't have a car or lots of personal belongings. Great location, good perks and stuff. Just also very overpriced for what you're getting. You'll probably enjoy it more if you're rarely in your room tbh. If you like to stay in your room a lot then it's probably not a great idea because the individual rooms are very small"
3054,j6ethlk,comment,Daggerdogx,WWU,1675026579,"Not great. Generally not as scary as reviews make it seem though. That's my experience anyways. We've had maintenance come like once, took them 5 min, easy in and out. The power does tend to go out if there's a bad storm, but that's pretty normal most places. Management can be slow to get back to you about things. Like others have said, the trash situation is a joke and they don't pick it up enough so they lump recycling and trash together instead of seperating it. Also there are tons of people who don't pick up after their dogs which is really fucking annoying, but not really the apartments fault. When we moved in there were fruit flies in the kitchen and the cleaning wasn't great, but I wouldn't say it was completely disgusting or anything. Internet is fine. Parking can be a challenge if you like to go do things at night and don't have a reserved spot. If you're not parked by around 7-8pm there's probably not going to be any parking available until the next day (unless you have a reserved spot). I've heard the gym is nice but I don't use it much. There are also shared outside barbecues that might be nice at some point but it's winter so no one uses them rn. Also. ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS take pictures and videos of your apartment upon move-in (before moving any items inside) and before you move out. One of the biggest complaints at Lark is them trying to charge you for damage that was already there. I haven't moved out yet and I renewed for next year so I'm not sure if that'll be the case for me, but I literally spent about an hour taking pictures of the apartment so they couldn't come after me for false damage charges."

Currently I'm looking for new merch, thinking ab getting a tattoo based on the Manga/show, trying to collect the Manga slowly over time (I'm budgeting). I think about the show a lot and it makes me really happy and excited and I love just delving into all of the details of the show and Manga. I want to share it with everyone I know but some common responses I get are either people calling me a weeb and thinking I'm lame (I'm not even a big anime person), or just being generally annoyed and not seeing the show in the same light I do. I just joined a discord for the show and spent about an hour talking to someone about it and felt a decent bit better after. The hardest part is just I feel like this show is a big part of my interests and when people reject that it feels like they're rejecting me. But I'm trying to work it into my head that people like me and just don't like everything I'm into. And that I'm the same way."

When I'm talking to people I'll bring it up and talk about it usually once every day or two. I guess I talk about it quite a bit because people have started getting annoyed with me and someone I talk to a lot got irritated and told me flat out they don't care about it and they're not interested in it so I should stop bringing it up (they were pretty annoyed and angry). The reason I talk about it so much to this person in particular is because they're my favorite person and so when I'm really interested in something or excited, I like to share that with them and talk about it because I'm excited. They don't want me to do that anymore and I'm honestly kind of hurt by the way they got angry and said this. Should I just not talk about it with them at all anymore? I think the main issue is that I repeat myself because either I don't remember I said it before, or I have something to add to the conversation from last time but end up repeating stuff about it. I just want to share my excitement with them but they couldn't care less about the topic and can get pretty annoyed if I do."

For about 8 hours straight. To the point where I was laying on the bathroom floor spooning a towel and trying not to throw up. Ever since then, eating my normal diet induced intense nausea, dizziness, light headedness, and really bad fatigue. I've had to start a low fodmap diet which has improved my symptoms a LOT. I'm slowly starting to re-introduce things but overall it seems to be improving slowly."

I thought my ibs went away (it was brought on by covid) and I was eating everything normal again, and then a few days after that it's back to stomach pain, vertigo type dizziness, and I'm gonna have to go back to eating my ibs diet it seems like."

When lots of snow falls, it condenses under the weight, and won't just dust off your car while you drive. It has the potential to collapse into your windshield while driving, or slide off into the windshield of whoevers behind you. Not to mention the possibility of ice underneath that could fly off your car and seriously injure someone (this isn't a rare occurrence). Take the extra few minutes to clear off your car roof. If you don't have a snow scraper, a broom works well too."

For example, Whole Foods doesn't allow a whole list of preservatives and crap in any of their food, so I usually shop there. It's a bit pricier but it allows me peace of mind so I find that it's worth it. Treating all food in America like poison is definitely not accurate (or good)."

I got covid at the start of the year, I'm healthy and have no other issues. Now I have long covid, get dizziness and nausea frequently, and basically have had to change my entire life to accommodate long covid symptoms. And the cdc came out saying about 20% of people who get covid, go on to get long covid. And that number is thought to be lower than the real one. So no, going to class and spreading covid is not more important than a quarter of academics. Wtf is wrong with you"

Would it be worth delaying my bachelor's in biology (with a minor in psychology) to add another minor in Japanese? Or is just having Japanese as a second language on your resumè just as impactful without having to put any additional money into college? Part of the reason I'm considering trying to get a minor in Japanese is because I'd love to travel there and possibly look into working there at some point in my life, especially in the field of biology. In addition, I'm planning on going for either a masters degree or PhD after my bachelor's."

Now here I am trying to the low fodmap diet because it seems as though if I eat fodmaps I get super intense nausea, and really bad stomach pain.

I have noticed that anxiety greatly exacerbates the symptoms though which is frustrating when I'm a college student taking pretty advanced classes and applying to jobs and such. The non-stressful times are hard enough with these symptoms, add in stress and it's practically impossible to manage anything."

I was thinking of getting my booster bc I've heard some people say it can clear up symptoms, but I had covid in September and online it says to wait 3 months before getting the booster. So should I wait 3 months to get it, or take it whenever because it might help with long covid? Thanks in advance.

PS. The symptoms are basically all GI symptoms, although a bit of dizziness comes with them. It doesn't happen every day, sometimes I go a few days without them. Sometimes a week. But they always seem to come back, to the point where I'm sitting on the bathroom floor for usually 4-8 hours."
3145,t3_ynh2iu,post,Daggerdogx,LongCovid,1667710494,"So I got covid the first day of moving in to a new apartment. I was exposed by my girlfriends sister, who didn't know she had it. At first it was very mild, but a week later I ended up going to the hospital because I had woken up with extreme nausea and pretty severe stomach pain. I was curled up in a ball on the bathroom floor using a towel as a pillow, doubled over in pain that came and went, and felt like gas (although there wasn't any other symptoms of gas) but I felt my stomach/intestines shifting around in discomfort, possibly spasming, who knows. It slowly got better and I basically avoided most food for a while. Cut to about a month and a half later. My covid symptoms seemed to have disappeared for about 2 weeks, and then I started getting random bouts of nausea and mild dizziness. I missed some college classes due to it. Seemed to slowly get better. Then it got worse again, and that's where I'm at rn. It's been about a week straight of stomach discomfort every single night (not usually during the day, interestingly enough), with stomach pain, diahrrea, and nausea, and mild dizziness. I was wondering if anyone else had experienced anything like this? I'm trying to get in to see a doctor atm, and I'm also starting an elimination diet to see if maybe I have developed a good allergy, as I've heard covid can cause them. Thanks if you read all this, most of it is just venting with curiosity if I'm alone in struggling with these symptoms.

Edit: I'd also like to add that my anxiety has seemed to get much worse at night. During the day it's only a bit worse, but along with the stomach symptoms, I will usually have pretty severe anxiety and panic attacks to an extent. I have had anxiety, ADHD, and depression prior to covid."

From urgent cares that are never able to take patients the same day, to ER waits over about 7 hours just to get a doctor in for 2 minutes. Does anyone have any recommendations for places that aren't like this? Obviously it makes sense that some places have waits and that's fine, but when it's 5 hours just to get checked in at an urgent care clinic, or clinics not accepting any more patients for the day even though they're open for another 5 hours, it's just ridiculous. Feeling pretty disheartened in being able to find health care."

Then I got long covid and have been struggling with the symptoms, and it has made it very hard to focus. I know I'm not going to pass organic chemistry 1 with a C- or above (and might end up getting an F, possibly a D). I was trying to register for organic chemistry 1 again for next quarter but it won't let me because it says if I have a passing grade or if I'm in the class, I need to wait until phase 3 registration which is basically the first day of the next quarter, in which case all of the organic chemistry classes will probably be full. It does say if I'm currently in the class I can talk to the registrar and try to get an overrule code, but I'm not sure if my situation warrants it. Should I just not do organic chemistry next quarter and try to do it the following quarter? Any advice would be greatly appreciated"
