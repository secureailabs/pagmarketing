It went nowhere in that sub, but my questions persist, and I\\'m hoping there are more answers to be found on an HPV-specific sub.  If you have moral issues with non-monogamy, please move on, I\\'m here for medical assistance, not moralizing.  Thank you.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy first wife developed pre-cancerous cells on her cervix after our second child was born, then had them recur several years later.  At the time, I did not know that her condition was the result of HPV.  Since I have had a vasectomy, when I found a new partner after my divorce, we did not use condoms.  That partner never developed anything that showed up on a PAP after two years of unprotected sex.  My current partner (fiancée) has the same pre-cancerous cells on her cervix as my ex-wife.  She is being monitored by her OB-GYN, who insists the strain of HPV she has is \"not one of the bad ones\", and therefore not covered by the vaccine.  \\n\\nMy fiancée and I have both been vaccinated now, and she is still undergoing regular colposcopies to monitor any developments.  \\n\\nThis infection has put a serious damper on our swinging, as there is a non-zero chance I\\'m walking around with a \"magic cancer wand\".  So my questions are;\\n\\n1.  How likely are either of us to be infected and/or communicable at this point?  We\\'ve been monogamous since pre-covid, so, at least three years, which presumably is long enough for both of us to have \\'cleared\\' the infection.\\n\\n2.  If my fiancee doesn\\'t have \\'one of the bad strains\\' (they don\\'t know which one it is, just that it\\'s not the \\'really scary\\' ones), then why is she being monitored for cancer, and what the hell is on her cervix?\\n\\n3.  If I can\\'t be tested, and the virus can lay dormant for years, how can I know (or prove) that I pose no more significant risk than the average person?\\n\\n4.  Is it appropriate to lead with \"Hey, having sex with us may eventually kill you, lol\", or is there some other less off-putting way to deal with disclosure?\\n\\n5.

Got off the plane, and got on the shuttle to Alamo, a 40 minute drive away.  \\n\\nI get to the counter, and I\\'m signing my paperwork.  Guy asks me if I want insurance.  Now, where I\\'m from (Ontario, Canada) you can\\'t drive without insurance.  So I say yes, not knowing the insurance is $33 *a day*.  So for the nine days I was there, I paid $300+ for insurance.  With the exchange rate at the time, this amounted to almost $500 Canadian.  For comparison, the flight, hotel and rental for the week was about 800 CDN.  I could have *bought* a car for 500 bucks and abandoned it at the airport.\\n\\nBut, I was determined to not let it disturb me on the *first day* of my vacation.... I was going to enjoy this trip, god dammit!  \\n\\nAs a \"thank you\" for renting with Alamo, they gave me a *free cassette* of \"Drive Happy Tunes\", that included *Don\\'t Worry Be Happy* by Bobby McFerrin, which was an enormous, monster hit in the late 80s, but by the time of this story (mid 90s) had been overplayed and was essentially a punchline.\\n\\nNo matter!  I was *determined* to have a good time!  I\\'ll *show them*!!

It takes away time from patient care. I’ve seen nurses literally lose meds or drop IVs causing them to leak. Pharmacy is always the one thrown under the bus. Yes communication is necessary but to act like pharmacists complain just to complain isn’t it. And nurses take advantage of this and don’t try or learn. When we do fix what needs to be fixed, they don’t get back to us and we can’t reach them bc “they’re in another parallel universe now” which leads to a communication barrier so we have to do more with less.
