I applied for contract jobs, but either they don't get back or the same person just spams my email everyday with the same jobs and doesnt answer.  I got interviews for like 2 out of 30 industry positons I applied to, and I have been looking for a job for twice that time.

Not exactly in BFN as its in a  major city but I would have to be floating to the sister hospitals in more rural areas, and as someone that doesn't have a car, idk how that will work.

If you have no reason to believe they’ll have drive or listen don’t take students. Don’t take that out on people just trying to make a living. If you don’t think people can do basic pharmacist duties, which every school teaches, without a residency then why are you in this career? If you need a residency to teach you basic things then you should be reporting these schools to the ACPE. That’s literally dangerous. You talk about overassesing your abilities but not under assessing other people’s abilities. Like I said not everyone gets a residency and there are people that do have the abilities you want. You just won’t see them if you hate keep. Over assessing your abilities is thinking you don’t need to learn or being lazy like you said. We’ve come to the point where doing any job in pharmacy just gets more and more check marks for requirements not bc you actually need them. No pharmacist is perfect and thinking residency trained pharmacists won’t be problematic is over assessing their abilities.
